This has resulted in a considerable digital divide between patient care and education, one that poorly serves practitioners and organizations, even as learning becomes ever more important to both. In this perspective, we advocate for the enhancement of existing health information systems so that they intentionally facilitate learning. We describe three well-regarded frameworks for learning that can point toward how health care information systems can best evolve to support learning. The Master Adaptive Learner model suggests ways that the individual practitioner can best organize their activities to ensure continual self-improvement. The PDSA cycle similarly proposes actions for improvement but at a health care organizationʼs workflow level. Sengeʼs Five Disciplines of the Learning Organization, a more general framework from the business literature, serves to further inform how disparate information and knowledge flows can be managed for continual improvement. Our main thesis holds that these types of learning frameworks should inform the design and integration of information systems serving the health professions. An underutilized mediator of educational improvement is the ubiquitous electronic health record. The authors list learning analytic opportunities, including potential modifications of learning management systems and the electronic health record, that would enhance health professions education and support the shared goal of delivering high-quality evidence-based health care.","",""

However, training an ITS that can customise students' learning trajectories suffers from cold-start, time-consumption, human labour-intensity, and cost problems.

To this end, we propose HIN-KT, a novel heterogeneous information network (HIN)-based pre-processing model, to further enhance the performance of existing KT models. An HIN is first built to model student–question–skill interactions.

This is known as the Knowledge Tracing (KT) problem in the literature. Effectively solving the KT problem would unlock the potential of computer-aided education applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, curriculum learning, and learning materials’ recommendation. Moreover, from a more general viewpoint, a student may represent any kind of intelligent agents including both human and artificial agents.

Towards effective learning outcome assessment, the exam script generation problem has attracted many attentions recently. But the research in this field is still in its early stage. Two essential issues have been ignored largely by existing solutions. First, given a course, it is unknown yet how to generate an quality exam script which concurrently has (i) the proper difficulty level, (ii) the coverage of essential knowledge points, (iii) the capability to distinguish academic performances between students, and (iv) the student scores in normal distribution. Second, while frequently encountered in practice, it is unknown so far how to generate a pair of high quality exam scripts which are equivalent in assessment (i.e., the student scores are comparable by taking either of them) but have significantly different sets of questions. To fill the gap, this paper proposes ExamGAN (Exam Script Generative Adversarial Network) to generate high quality exam scripts, and then extends ExamGAN to T-ExamGAN (Twin-ExamGAN) to generate a pair of high quality exam scripts. Based on extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, it has verified the superiority of proposed solutions in various aspects against the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we have conducted a case study which demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed solution in the real teaching scenarios.","Computing and Processing, Hidden Markov models, Generative adversarial networks, Knowledge engineering, Training, Gaussian distribution, Task analysis, Databases, Deep knowledge tracing, educational data mining, exam script generation, generative adversarial network",""

The task of KT is to help students learn more effectively by predicting their next mastery of knowledge based on their historical exercise sequences. Nowadays, many related works have emerged in this field, such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and deep knowledge tracing methods. Despite the progress that has been made in KT, existing techniques still have the following limitations: 1) Previous studies address KT by only exploring the observational sparsity data distribution, and the counterfactual data distribution has been largely ignored. 2) Current works designed for KT only consider either the entity relationships between questions and concepts, or the relations between two concepts, and none of them investigates the relations among students, questions, and concepts, simultaneously, leading to inaccurate student modeling. To address the above limitations, we propose a graph counterfactual augmentation method for knowledge tracing. Concretely, to consider the multiple relationships among different entities, we first uniform students, questions, and concepts in graphs, and then leverage a heterogeneous graph convolutional network to conduct representation learning. To model the counterfactual world, we conduct counterfactual transformations on students' learning graphs by changing the corresponding treatments and then exploit the counterfactual outcomes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GraphCA method compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.","Computing and Processing, Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies, General Topics for Engineers, Robotics and Control Systems, Representation learning, Knowledge engineering, Knowledge based systems, Data models, Bayes methods, Convolutional neural networks, Task analysis, Contrastive learning, counterfactual representation, graph neural network, knowledge tracing",""

KT involves predicting a student’s mastery of knowledge based on the student’s learning activity and plays a crucial role for recommending appropriate educational content at the individual level. While several deep learning-based KT models have been proposed, most consider only the interaction sequence of the target student, ignoring the interactions of other students. Furthermore, in practice, all model graphs should be incremented as more student interaction data is obtained, implying that they should be rebuilt to remain up-to-date, which is time-consuming. Moreover, existing graph-based KT models typically rely on predefined knowledge graphs for graph-based learning. Constructing a knowledge graph is labor-intensive, requiring a higher understanding of the domain knowledge. To address these problems, we propose a new inductive graph-based KT (IGKT) framework, which fully utilizes a subgraph extraction approach from a student-exercise bipartite graph, promising scalability and efficiency for practical applicability. The proposed framework consists of three key components: subsequence extraction, subgraph extraction and exericse information addition, and graph-based correctness prediction. For the third component, we test three variants to determine the effectiveness of integrating the timestamp and graph information, thereby creating three models for comparison: IGKT-Basic, IGKT with timestamps (IGKT-TS), and IGKT with graph attention layers that incorporate timestamps as edge features (IGKT-GAT). Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that the models based on the proposed framework are superior over state-of-the-art models, and IGKT-GAT is the most effective implementation of the proposed framework. We further validate the effectiveness of the IGKT models through an ablation study and multiple in-depth analyses.Graphical abstract:","Knowledge tracing, Graph-based knowledge tracing, Inductive graph, IGKT",""

A particular direction is to model students' learning outcomes in the context of their learning experience, i.e., the various student, course, and pedagogical elements. It contributes to a better understanding of the learning process, a more accurate prediction of students' attainments on the learning outcomes, and improvements in the design of learning activities to maximize student learning. However, most of the existing work in this area relies on statistical analysis that makes assumptions about attribute independence or simple linear dependence, which may not accurately reflect real-life scenarios. In contrast, the study described in this paper adopted a neural network-based approach to investigate the impact of students' learning experience on different service-learning outcomes. A neural network with attention mechanisms was constructed to predict students' service-learning outcomes by modeling the contextual information from their various learning experiences. In-depth evaluation experiments on a large-scale dataset collected from more than 10,000 students showed that this proposed model achieved better accuracy on predicting service-learning outcomes. More importantly, it could capture the interdependence between different aspects of student learning experience and the learning outcomes. We believe that this framework can be extended to student modeling for other types of learning activities.

The study critically evaluates the effectiveness of these grouping techniques in capturing and distinguishing students’ diverse learning patterns. Through a comprehensive analysis of ten methodologies used to cluster students in traditional programming courses and programming MOOCs, we aim to reveal how students from different cohorts exhibit varying learning behaviors and outcomes. By examining diverse models of student learning, we assess whether students in distinct groups indeed demonstrate discernible disparities in their educational journeys. Our meticulous data analysis uncovers compelling insights that challenge the notion of predefined student stereotypes and their practical utility within group-based adaptation settings. This research contributes to the discourse on student grouping by highlighting the limitations of traditional categorizations and introducing innovative approaches to understanding student diversity and tailoring educational interventions accordingly.

Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown promise. However, optimizing DL models requires setting numerous parameters, and demands substantial labeled datasets, which are labor-intensive to create.; Objective: This study proposes a semi-supervised model that can utilize labeled and unlabeled data to accurately segment kidneys, tumors, and cysts on CT images, even with limited labeled samples.; Methods: An end-to-end semi-supervised learning model named MTAN (Mean Teacher Attention N-Net) is designed to segment kidneys, tumors, and cysts on CT images. The MTAN model is built on the foundation of the AN-Net architecture, functioning dually as teachers and students. In its student role, AN-Net learns conventionally. In its teacher role, it generates objects and instructs the student model on their utilization to enhance learning quality. The semi-supervised nature of MTAN allows it to effectively utilize unlabeled data for training, thus improving performance and reducing overfitting.; Results: We evaluate the proposed model using two CT image datasets (KiTS19 and KiTS21). In the KiTS19 dataset, MTAN achieved segmentation results with an average Dice score of 0.975 for kidneys and 0.869 for tumors, respectively. Moreover, on the KiTS21 dataset, MTAN demonstrates its robustness, yielding average Dice scores of 0.977 for kidneys, 0.886 for masses, 0.861 for tumors, and 0.759 for cysts, respectively.; Conclusion: The proposed MTAN model presents a compelling solution for accurate medical image segmentation, particularly in scenarios where the labeled data is scarce. By effectively utilizing the unlabeled data through a semi-supervised learning approach, MTAN mitigates overfitting concerns and achieves high-quality segmentation results. The consistent performance across two distinct datasets, KiTS19 and KiTS21, underscores model's reliability and potential for clinical reference.","AN-Net, KiTS, MTAN, Medical image segmentation, kidney tumor segmentation, semi-supervised learning",""

In Computer Science Education (CSE), Adaptive Learning Systems (ALS) can provide students with customized lessons, exercises, and assessments based on their previous knowledge, strengths, and weaknesses. Some literature reviews focus on adaptive learning techniques, but none specifically analyze the methods used in adaptive systems in CSE. Our overall objective is to identify the computing techniques that are implemented within ALS to provide adaptive computer education in higher education. We conducted a scoping review (SR) based on the Guidelines for performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, defining six research questions and a search string. We performed searches in four databases, retrieving 512 documents. After applying the selection criteria, we selected 29 works. The results present quantitative and qualitative data from those 29 studies. Most research has used adaptive learning in programming education (12 articles) and databases (9 papers). Nine articles used learning styles as the core of adaptation, with the Felder-Silverman model being used by seven of them. The most commonly used approach was the rule-based system approach built by experts within the proposal, which was used in 17.24% of the articles. Clustering, collaborative filtering, fuzzy logic, and K-NN were used in 10.34% of the proposals. The positive aspect of “delivering adaptive content” was pointed out in seven articles. As for negative aspects, the problem of lack of student engagement was mentioned in four articles. This study discusses the application of dynamic and static models based on learning styles (LS) and the challenges involved in their use. Additionally, another aspect pointed out is that it is crucial to carefully consider pedagogical aspects in learning systems and have mixed development teams. The study also discusses student motivation and the use of gamification elements as a strategy to engage students in electronic learning systems. Finally, the results also indicate that the level of student knowledge is typically represented by a student model (SM), and the growing trend is the use of hybrid SMs. The research identified the most studied areas in ALS in CSE, such as computer programming and databases. The most common techniques used in ALS were rule-based systems built by experts, fuzzy logic, and clustering. The most common feature of ALS identified was learning resources, and the majority of studies focused on investigating the impact of system accuracy.

Predictions from learner models are frequently used in combination with mastery criterion decision rules to make pedagogical decisions. Important aspects of learner models, such as learning rate and item difficulty, can be estimated from prior data. A critical function of AIS is to have students practice new content once the AIS predicts that they have 'mastered' current content or learned it to some criterion. For making this prediction, individual student parameters (e.g., for learning rate) are frequently unavailable due to having no prior data about a student, and thus population-level parameters or rules-of-thumb are typically applied instead. In this paper, we will argue and demonstrate via simulation and data analysis that even in best-case scenarios, learner models assuming equal learning rates for students will inevitably lead to systematic errors that result in suboptimal pedagogical decisions for most learners. This finding leads us to conclude that systematic errors should be expected, and mechanisms to adjust predictions to account for them should be included in AIS. We introduce two solutions that can adjust for student differences ""online"" in a running system: one that tracks systemic errors of the learner model (not the student) and adjusts accordingly, and a student-level performance adaptive feature. We demonstrate these solutions' efficacy and practicality on six large educational datasets and show that these features improved model accuracy in all tested datasets.

Driven by the rapid advancements in deep learning techniques, deep neural networks have been recently adopted for knowledge tracing and have exhibited unique advantages and capabilities. Due to the complex multilayer structure of deep neural networks and their ""black box"" operations, these deep learning based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models also suffer from non-transparent decision processes. The lack of interpretability has painfully impeded DLKT models' practical applications, as they require the user to trust in the model's output. To tackle such a critical issue for today's DLKT models, we present an interpreting method by leveraging explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) techniques. Specifically, the interpreting method focuses on understanding the DLKT model's predictions from the perspective of its sequential inputs. We conduct comprehensive evaluations to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed interpreting method at the skill-answer pair level. Moreover, the interpreting results also capture the skill-level semantic information, including the skill-specific difference, distance and inner relationships.

This paper proposes an aid system that uses neural networks to achieve accurate recipe projections to facilitate life. A deep learning system based on Decoder and Encoder is implemented using CNN and Transformer. The CNN reduces the memory cost by transforming the image to a vector, achieving faster processing. The Transformer is used to determine ingredients' presence and combine the information of existing dishes to construct an instruction. Such a network can facilitate food production and research. It is making the creation of unique dishes convenient by revolutionizing the method of recording.

Backbone network tests include ResNet50, ResNet152 without attention, ResNet152 with attention, Vgg16, and AlexNet.

This process used the complex model as a trainer to the student model by basing the student training on the result of the teacher model, achieving a similar level of accuracy with a significantly lower complexity and size.

Deep learning-based methods, such as recurrent neural networks, memory-augmented neural networks, and attention-based neural networks, have recently been used in KT. Such methods have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing the latent dependencies of a learner’s knowledge state on recent exercises. However, these methods have limitations when it comes to dealing with the so-called Skill Switching Phenomenon (SSP), i.e., when learners respond to exercises in an e-learning system, the latent skills in the exercises typically switch irregularly. SSP will deteriorate the performance of deep learning-based approaches for simulating the learner’s knowledge state during skill switching, particularly when the association between the switching skills and the previously learned skills is weak. To address this problem, we propose the Memory-augmented Attentive Network (MAN), which combines the advantages of memory-augmented neural networks and attention-based neural networks. Specifically, in MAN, memory-augmented neural networks are used to model learners’ longer term memory knowledge, while attention-based neural networks are used to model learners’ recent term knowledge. In addition, we design a context-aware attention mechanism that automatically weighs the tradeoff between these two types of knowledge. With extensive experiments on several e-learning datasets, we show that MAN effectively improve predictive accuracies of existing state-of-the-art DLKT methods.","E-learning, knowledge tracing, deep learning, multi-head attention mechanism, memory-augmented neural network",""

To facilitate KT's development, most existing methods pursue high accuracy of student performance prediction but neglect the consistency between students’ dynamic knowledge state with their learning process. Moreover, they focus on learning outcomes at a single learning interaction, while student progress at continuous learning interactions is more instructive. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for the KT task and propose a novel model named Learning Process-consistent Knowledge Tracing (LPKT), which captures the evolution of students’ knowledge state through monitoring their learning progress. Specifically, we utilize both the positive effect of the learning gain and the negative effect of forgetting in learning to calculate student progress in continuous learning interactions. Then, considering that the rate of progress is student-specific, we extend LPKT to LPKT-S by explicitly distinguishing the individual progress rate of each student. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that LPKT and LPKT-S could obtain more appropriate knowledge states in line with the learning process. Moreover, LPKT and LPKT-S outperform state-of-the-art KT methods on student performance prediction. Our work indicates a promising future research direction for KT, which is highly interpretable and accurate.","Computing and Processing, Hidden Markov models, Task analysis, Monitoring, Education, Predictive models, Logistics, Computer science, Educational data mining, knowledge tracing, student progress, learning process, learning gain, forgetting effect",""

In this study, a deep learning knowledge tracing model based on a dynamic key-value memory network model with strong interpretability is selected as the foundation.

Computational models that simulate learner interactions and data hold great promise for educational technology as well. Amongst others, simulated learners can be used for teacher training, for generating and evaluating hypotheses on human learning, for developing adaptive learning algorithms, for building virtual worlds in which students can practice collaboration skills with simulated pals, and for testing learning environments. This paper provides the first systematic literature review on simulated learners in the broad area of artificial intelligence in education and related fields, focusing on the decade 2010-19. We analyze the trends regarding the use of simulated learners in educational technology within this decade, the purposes for which simulated learners are being used, and how the validity of the simulated learners is assessed. We find that simulated learner models tend to represent only narrow aspects of student learning. And, surprisingly, we also find that almost half of the studies using simulated learners do not provide any evidence that their modeling addresses the most fundamental question in simulation design – is the model valid? This poses a threat to the reliability of results that are based on these models. Based on our findings, we propose that future research should focus on developing more complete simulated learner models. To validate these models, we suggest a standard and universal criterion, which is based on the lasting idea of Turing’s Test. We discuss the properties of this test and its potential to move the field of simulated learners forward.","Simulated students, Turing test, Student modeling, Synthetic data generation",""

Recent ABSA research focuses on utilizing multi-task learning (MTL) to achieve less computational costs and better performance. However, there are certain limits in MTL-based ABSA. For example, unbalanced labels and sub-task learning difficulties may result in the biases that some labels and sub-tasks are overfitting, while the others are underfitting. To address these issues, inspired by neuro-symbolic learning systems, we propose a meta-based self-training method with a meta-weighter (MSM). We believe that a generalizable model can be achieved by appropriate symbolic representation selection (in-domain knowledge) and effective learning control (regulation) in a neural system. Thus, MSM trains a teacher model to generate in-domain knowledge (e.g., unlabeled data selection and pseudo-label generation), where the generated pseudo-labels are used by a student model for supervised learning. Then, the meta-weighter of MSM is jointly trained with the student model to provide each instance with sub-task-specific weights to coordinate their convergence rates, balancing class labels, and alleviating noise impacts introduced from self-training. The following experiments indicate that MSM can utilize 50% labeled data to achieve comparable results to state-of-arts models in ABSA and outperform them with all labeled data.","Computing and Processing, Robotics and Control Systems, Signal Processing and Analysis, Task analysis, Data models, Computational modeling, Training, Sentiment analysis, Portable computers, Gold, Aspect-based sentiment analysis, meta learning, self-training",""

However, self-regulation demands i) an encouraging environment and ii) student motivation. First, adding Open Learner Models (OLM) to learning environments encourages self-regulation by providing clear feedback on which skills students need to prioritize. Second, gamifying these environments holds the potential to maximize student motivation. Nevertheless, empirical evidence on whether gamification improves learning self-regulation in OLM-based applications is lacking to our best knowledge. Therefore, we conducted a one-factor (gamification: yes or no) experimental study (n = 39) to test if gamification improves the self-regulation and performance of learners who used an OLM-based Intelligent Tutoring System to complete multiple-choice questions. Surprisingly, we found no significant differences in self-regulation and performance when comparing the gamified and non-gamified groups. Considering prior research did not investigate gamification in similar settings, the fact that gamification’s effect varies depending on the context and learning outcome likely explains our findings. Thus, practitioners must be cautious in using gamification amid the lack of empirical evidence on its effectiveness in a given context/learning outcome. Researchers need to understand how gamification affects different learning outcomes in varied contexts. Accordingly, future research must investigate and ground how self-regulation, OLM, and gamification work together.","Gamification, Self-regulation of learning, Open learner model, Intelligent tutoring systems, Experiment",""

Furthermore, previous works generally neglect the multiple semantic information contained in knowledge states and sparse learning interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel model named CAKT that couples contrastive learning with attention networks for interpretable knowledge tracing. Specifically, we use three attention-based encoders to model three dynamic factors of the Item Response Theory (IRT) model, based on designed learning sequences. Then, we identify two key properties related to the knowledge states and learning interactions: consistency and separability. We utilize contrastive learning to incorporate the semantic information of the above properties into the representations of knowledge states and learning interactions. With the training goal of contrastive learning, we can obtain more representative representations of them.

However, studies show that engaging students in ST is challenging, especially concerning aspects like change over time and feedback. Using computational system models and a system dynamics approach can support students in overcoming these challenges when making sense of complex phenomena. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that examines how 10th grade students engage in aspects of ST through computational system modeling as part of a Next Generation Science Standards-aligned project-based learning unit on chemical kinetics. We show students' increased capacity to explain the underlying mechanism of the phenomenon in terms of change over time that goes beyond linear causal relationships. However, student models and their accompanying explanations were limited in scope as students did not address feedback mechanisms as part of their modeling and explanations. In addition, we describe specific challenges students encountered when evaluating and revising models. In particular, we show epistemological barriers to fruitful use of real-world data for model revision.

Knowledge tracing is one of the most popular technologies for this purpose, and deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Compared to classical models, such as Bayesian knowledge tracing, which track students' knowledge proficiencies, deep learning-based knowledge tracing is usually modeled to predict students' performances on questions, while ignoring the interpretability of students' knowledge states. However, for many practical applications, such as learning resource recommendation, it would be more helpful if we could explicitly track students' abilities or knowledge proficiencies separately from performance prediction. Researchers in psychometric area already designed cognitive diagnosis solutions to quantify the knowledge states of students in static conditions (e.g., examination), where the educational priors (i.e., factors related to students' learning process) were proved beneficial for student modeling. Inspired by this, we propose dynamic cognitive diagnosis , which integrates the interpretability of educational priors from cognitive diagnosis into deep learning-based knowledge tracing methods. We first discuss and provide evidence of which educational priors can be integrated, including question attributes and interaction function. Then we show the effects of using the educational priors in deep learning-based knowledge tracing from two aspects, i.e., interpretability and accuracy. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we prove that properly chosen priors can enable deep learning-based methods to evaluate students' knowledge states in a manner that is consistent with domain knowledge or human experience. Moreover, educational priors also improve the accuracy of student performance prediction.","Computing and Processing, General Topics for Engineers, Hidden Markov models, Knowledge engineering, Roads, Recurrent neural networks, Predictive models, Learning systems, Analytical models, Cognitive diagnosis, deep learning, intelligent tutoring systems, knowledge tracing, personalized e-learning",""

However, there are two crucial issues in deep learning-based KT models. First, the knowledge concepts are used to predict learners' performance instead of exercises. This choice ignores the actual difference among exercises, which leads to the KT model's inability to explore the rich information at the exercise level, thus, weakening the KT model's performance. Second, the actual difference in prior knowledge is neglected. Therefore, in-depth research of these two types of the actual differences offers the possibility to improve the prediction performance of KT further. To this end, we propose a fine-grained knowledge tracing model (FGKT) 1 to capture these two types of actual differences. We first obtain the exercise representations by considering the corresponding knowledge concepts and actual difference among exercises. Then, an effective attention mechanism is designed to capture the relevance between assessment exercises and historical interactions to acquire individual prior knowledge. Finally, we evaluate the proposed FGKT model on several available benchmark datasets. The experiment results show that our model surpasses benchmark KT models by up to 7% in prediction performance on the latest ASSISTments dataset.","Computing and Processing, General Topics for Engineers, Hidden Markov models, Predictive models, Task analysis, Computational modeling, Training, Probabilistic logic, Estimation, Adaptive learning, attention mechanism, intel- ligent tutoring systems, knowledge tracing (KT), personalized e-learning",""

While many pre-college students use system modeling tools, there is limited evidence of student reasoning about causal relationships that interact in diverging and converging chains, and how these affect system behavior. A chemistry unit on gas phenomena was implemented in two successive years with 73 high school students. Although the phenomena could be explained with simple linear causal reasoning, many student models included surprising and problematic causal chains and non-linear patterns. Commonly, discussion about student models in classrooms and interviews focuses on individual causal relationships. However, in our experience, this can fail to bring to the surface conceptual issues that result from the combination of two or more relationships. Using interview data from 19 students, we looked for instances where students explained their conceptions and we identified questioning strategies that elicited these explanations. Questions that appeared most productive asked about distal relationships between nonadjacent variables in model substructures of three to four variables. In response to these questions, eight students expressed their thinking about relationship combinations, including unexpected reasoning that had not emerged during classroom instruction. Using exemplars from three interviews, we argue that students engage in complex causal reasoning that may be implicit and unexpected, and that if this is not recognized, it cannot be responded to during instruction. We suggest that using model substructures as a mutual visual referent along with a simple questioning strategy shows promise for helping students make their causal reasoning explicit.

The results indicate that: the most used learner characteristic is learning style even though the use of learning knowledge is on the rise; there is a rise in the use of machine learning algorithms in learner modelling; learning content is the most common target for adaptation; rules is the most utilized method in the adaptation model; and most adaptive online learning have not been evaluated in terms of learning. There is therefore a need for evaluation of the developed adaptive online learning and more studies that utilize more than one learner characteristic as the basis for adaptation and those that use machine learning.

The learner model, which is a representation of different learner’s characteristics, plays a key role in this adaptation. Research on educational psychology showed that emotion and learning have a hidden mutual relationship. If a learning process involves both cognitive and affective dimensions, then learning is like to be more usable, socially appropriate, acceptable and memorable, ultimately leading to significant improvement in the learner’s performance and the learning experience. However, traditional ITS ignore emotional aspects in learner modelling mostly; instead, they focus on learners’ cognition and motivation to maximise the knowledge to be achieved. The characteristics related to cognition are not well defined and primarily sparse when modelling a learner profile tailored to the learning domains. This study attempts to investigate the most common and relevant personal traits involved in the learning process based on the domains of learning. It also explores the most adopted techniques to identify such traits from log files of learners’ interactions with ITS without using physical and physiological sensors (i.e., camera, EEG) to model characteristics learner profiles for ITS aiming to improve its adaptiveness and leverage personalised learning.","",""

Compared to conventional methods, DKT has better predictive performance, but it also has some problems such as poor interpretability, and difficulties in reflecting the causal association between the learning process and test results. In this paper, a new DKT model is proposed based on an evolved Transformer structure (DKT-ETS). The encoder layer is composed of three coding networks with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, while inputs are three types of pre-processed data: process characteristic data, test label data, and answer results data. Output as three matrices of V, Q, K. The decoder layer also uses the attention mechanism, in which the input is the three matrices that come from encoder, and the output is the predicted result. By improving the structure, the new model introduces certain interpretability into the V, Q and K matrices of the attention mechanism. Thus, the causal relationship between the learning process and test results can be reflected a certain extent: the V matrix represents the characteristic information of the testee's learning process; the Q matrix reflects the knowledge point information examined by the current test item; and the K matrix represents the results of the previous tests. DKT-ETS was validated by using the large-scale knowledge tracking data set EdNet, and the results show that its ACC and AUC evaluation indicators have been significantly improved.","",""

It is one of the key components for building adaptive learning systems and has been investigated for decades. The empirical success of deep neural networks in the past few years has encouraged researchers in the learning science community to take similar approaches. However, most existing deep learning based knowledge tracing models have the following limitations: (1) Only use the correct/incorrect response, ignoring useful information from other modalities. (2) For works do consider multimodality use simple concatenation, which might not be the best way for modality fusion. (3) Design their network architectures manually via trial and error. To solve these problems, we propose Multimodal Fusion and Neural Architecture Search (MFNAS) in this paper. The commonly used neural architecture search technique could be considered as a special case of our proposed approach when there is only one modality involved. We further propose to use a new metric called time-weighted Area Under the Curve (weighted AUC) to measure how a sequence model performs with time. Our proposed approach MFNAS allows more efficient design of Knowledge Tracing models. Besides, evaluated on two public real datasets, the discovered model is able to achieve around 12% improvement in coefficient of determination, 2% improvement in AUC and weighted AUC compared with state of the art models. What’s more, unlike most existing works, we conduct McNemar’s test on the model predictions and the results are statistically significant.","Knowledge tracing, Multimodal fusion, Neural architecture search",""

Ways to address placement shortages have been the focus of international scholarship for decades, with a particular emphasis on models of supervision and the ratio of students to educator. Review articles, however, conclude that there is a lack of clarity on what constitutes a model or approach and inconsistent use of terminology. The aim of this scoping review was to identify, organise and synthesise existing evidence in relation to the supervision of allied health students whilst on practice placement to provide a clearer focus for future research and to support practice placement provider decision making. Methods: Five databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 onwards. Data were extracted and analysed according to approaches to supervision and student and/or educator outcomes for different models used. Each outcome was aligned to modified Kirkpatrick levels of evaluation. Results: 44 articles were reviewed. The terms models and approaches were poorly defined and often used interchangeably. Studies varied in the methods employed and were typically of low to moderate methodological quality with a dominance of Kirkpatrick Level 2a outcomes reported. Conclusion: This review identified some positive qualitative outcomes for both students and educators for shared supervision models despite the allegiance allied health holds to the single student model. Further rigorous investigation into the use of shared supervision in allied health through collecting data on indicators beyond perception, such as time use, cost, productivity and patient outcomes, is warranted.

Despite the potential therapeutic benefits of primer vaccine dosage regimens, public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine booster dose (VBD) acceptance and hesitancy vary among various sub-group populations. This study investigates COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance and compares the multi-dimensional potential factors influencing VBD acceptance and hesitancy among university teachers and the student community in Bangladesh.; Methods: This web-based cross-sectional study employed an anonymous, validated, and self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire items were adopted from a theoretical analysis of the recent relevant literature. The questionnaire was deployed in an on-line-enabled format (Google form) and conveniently distributed to 685 teachers and 990 students between 15th June, 2022 and 15th August, 2022 which resulted in the participation of 1250 (505 teachers vs.745 students) total respondents (response rate 73.72% vs. 75.25%) from various universities in Bangladesh. A non-parametric analytical tool (binary logistic regression) was applied to rationalize the study objectives and a Chi-squared test was performed to estimate the booster- hesitant risky group.; Results: The pooled COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance rates were 84.6% (95% CI 81.5─87.7) and 67.2% (95% CI 63.8─70.6) for teachers and students in the university academic community, respectively. In employing a binary logistic regression, this study revealed that out of twelve (12)multi-dimensional key predictors, ""equal safety"", ""risk-benefit ratio"", and ""variant control"" had a significant positive association with VBD acceptance in both sets (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, and p = 0.005, respectively). Varied effects were found for several predictors; post-vaccination ""side effects"" had a significant negative association (p = 0.020) and ""community protection"" had significant positive association (p = 0.034) with vaccine booster dose acceptance in the teachers community while these variables were insignificant in the students cohort. ""Trust"" had a highly significant positive association (p = 0.000);""communication"" and ""academic attainment"" had significant positive associations (p = 0.033 and 0.024, respectively) with VBD acceptance in the students cohort, while these predictors were insignificant in the teachers community. Women were more likely to receive a third dose of the vaccine (OR = 1.4 vs. 0.9 between teacher and student model); however, no significant association between gender and booster vaccine acceptance was found in a comparative Chi-squared model. Therefore, statistically, the booster vaccine-hesitant risky group was not found to implicate the massive booster vaccine drive among the university academic community.; Conclusions: COVID-19 booster vaccine acceptability among the student cohort was slightly lower than pre-roll-out intent. The teacher community was more inclined to get booster vaccinated. Moreover, differences were found between the multi-dimensional potential factors associated with VBD acceptance among teachers and students in university settings. This study explicitly confirmed positive attitudes toward the safety, health benefits, and variants control of the COVID-19 VBD under any circumstances. Post-vaccination side effect concern was found to be a barrier to administering booster shots and a reason for booster skepticism. Tailored communication and health education interventions need to be adopted to improve the public awareness of booster vaccine consequences, and limit booster skepticism.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that they have no known competing interest to declare.

However, deploying such large models on resource-constrained devices or embedded systems is challenging due to their high computational cost. Efforts such as model partition, pruning, or quantization have been used at the expense of accuracy loss. Knowledge distillation is a technique that transfers model knowledge from a well-trained model (teacher) to a smaller and shallow model (student). Instead of using a learning model on the cloud, we can deploy distilled models on various edge devices, significantly reducing the computational cost, memory usage and prolonging the battery lifetime. In this work, we propose a novel neuron manifold distillation (NMD) method, where the student models imitate the teacher's output distribution and learn the feature geometry of the teacher model. In addition, to further improve the cloud-based learning system reliability, we propose a confident prediction mechanism to calibrate the model predictions. We conduct experiments with different distillation configurations over multiple datasets. Our proposed method demonstrates a consistent improvement in accuracy-speed trade-offs for the distilled model.","Computing and Processing, Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies, Computational modeling, Task analysis, Cloud computing, Training, Servers, Deep learning, Predictive models, transfer learning, knowledge distillation",""

One of the possible uses of games in education is as game-based assessments (GBA), using game tasks to generate evidence about skills and content knowledge that can be valuable. There are different approaches in the literature to implement the assessment machinery of these GBA, all of them having strengths and drawbacks. In this article, we propose using multivariate Elo-based learner modeling, as we believe it has a strong potential in the context of GBA for three aims: first, to simultaneously measure students competence across several knowledge components in a game; second, to predict task performance; and finally, to estimate task difficulty within the game. To do so, we present our GBA Shadowspect, which is focused on solving geometry puzzles, and we depict our implementation using data collected from several high schools across the USA. We obtain high-performing results (AUC of 0.87) and demonstrate that the model enables analysis of how each student's competency evolves after each puzzle attempt. Moreover, the model provides accurate estimations of each task's difficulty, enabling iterative improvement of the game design. This study highlights the potential that multivariate Elo-based learner modeling has within the context of GBA, sharing lessons learned, and encouraging future researchers in the field to consider this algorithm to build their assessment machinery.","Computing and Processing, General Topics for Engineers, Games, Inference algorithms, Task analysis, Machinery, Behavioral sciences, Computational modeling, Context modeling, Educational technology, game-based assessment (GBA), K-12 education, knowledge inference, learning analytics",""

Although many technical efforts have been devoted to modeling students based on their question-response sequences, fine-grained interaction modeling between question-response pairs within each sequence is underexplored. This causes question-response representations less contextualized and further limits student modeling. To address this issue, we first conduct a data analysis and reveal the existence of complex cross effects between different question-response pairs within a sequence. Consequently, we propose MRT-KT, a multi-relational transformer for knowledge tracing, to enable fine-grained interaction modeling between question-response pairs. It introduces a novel relation encoding scheme based on knowledge concepts and student performance. Comprehensive experimental results show that MRT-KT outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing methods on four widely-used datasets, validating the effectiveness of considering fine-grained interaction for knowledge tracing.","Knowledge tracing, multi-relational transformer, user behavior modeling",""

This fact can be challenging because many investigators claim that motivation and student engagement are key to student success, especially in online education. This situation is even more problematic with the recent outbreak of COVID-19. There has been a major shift in the education sector from face-to- face instruction to online instruction.

However, the pre-training model is not suitable for sustainable computing and practical application because of its complex computations and large amount of hardware occupation. Therefore, we propose a slight pre-training model through knowledge distillation. Through knowledge distillation, the plenty of knowledge encoded in a large “teacher” model can be well transferred to a small “student” model, which greatly reduces the model parameters and inference time while maintaining the original performance. In the experiments, the model size is reduced by 87%, and the average inference time is reduced by approximately 86%. It can be trained and run much faster.

Despite the numerous effort to improve safety training, existing studies lacked consideration of trainees' different learning characters, nor did they adapt the suitable training materials to trainees' mastery of safety knowledge. Against this contextual backdrop, this research proposes a Bayesian-based Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model to recommend personalized training materials according to trainees's learning progress. The proposed BKT model tracks and predicts trainees' performance with their cognitive characters, abilities, and historical training records. It also adjusts trainee's probability of mastering safety knowledge concepts for determining future training sessions. In this way, the safety training is adaptive and personalized, thus more effective. An exploration study is conducted in the laboratory environment to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed BKT model. The research results showed that 83.33% of the respondents felt gained safety knowledge after the training, and 66.67% of the respondents affirmed the effectiveness of the BKT model-based training system in improving the effectiveness of training.

In this article, we take a first step towards mitigating one of the most advanced misclassification attacks in transfer learning. We design a distilled differentiator via activation-based network pruning to enervate the attack transferability while retaining accuracy. We adopt an ensemble structure from variant differentiators to improve the defence robustness. To avoid the bloated ensemble size during inference, we propose a two-phase defence, in which inference from the Student model is first performed to narrow down the candidate differentiators to be assembled, and later only a small, fixed number of them can be chosen to validate clean or reject adversarial inputs effectively. Our comprehensive evaluations on both large and small image recognition tasks confirm that the Student models with our defence of only 5 differentiators are immune to over 90% of the adversarial inputs with an accuracy loss of less than 10%. Our comparison also demonstrates that our design outperforms prior problematic defences.","Computing and Processing, Transfer learning, Task analysis, Mathematical models, Training, Computational modeling, Data models, Perturbation methods, Deep neural network, defence against adversarial examples, transfer learning, pre-trained model",""

In order to model students’ learning and forgetting behavior, LFEKT integrates multiple influencing factors to build a knowledge acquisition module and a knowledge retention module. Furthermore, LFEKT introduces a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the contextual relations of learned sequences.

Intelligent textbooks extend regular textbooks by integrating machine-manipulable knowledge, and the most popular type of integrated knowledge is a list of relevant concepts mentioned in the textbooks. With these concepts, multiple intelligent operations, such as content linking, content recommendation, or student modeling, can be performed. However, existing automatic keyphrase extraction methods, even supervised ones, cannot deliver sufficient accuracy to be practically useful in this task. Manual annotation by experts has been demonstrated to be a preferred approach for producing high-quality labeled data for training supervised models. However, most researchers in the education domain still consider the concept annotation process as an ad-hoc activity rather than a carefully executed task, which can result in low-quality annotated data. Using the annotation of concepts for the Introduction to Information Retrieval textbook as a case study, this paper presents a knowledge engineering method to obtain reliable concept annotations. As demonstrated by the data we collected, the inter-annotator agreement gradually increased along with our procedure, and the concept annotations we produced led to better results in document linking and student modeling tasks. The contributions of our work include a validated knowledge engineering procedure, a codebook for technical concept annotation, and a set of concept annotations for the target textbook, which could be used as a gold standard in further intelligent textbook research.

While much work has been done to provide adaptive assistance when students seek help, they may not seek help optimally. This had led to the growing interest in proactive adaptive assistance, where the tutor provides unsolicited assistance upon predictions of struggle or unproductivity. Determining when and whether to provide personalized support is a well-known challenge called the assistance dilemma. Addressing this dilemma is particularly challenging in open-ended domains, where there can be several ways to solve problems. Researchers have explored methods to determine when to proactively help students, but few of these methods have taken prior hint usage into account. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach to incorporate students’ hint usage in predicting their need for help. We explore its impact in an intelligent tutor that deals with the open-ended and well-structured domain of logic proofs. We present a controlled study to investigate the impact of an adaptive hint policy based on predictions of HelpNeed that incorporate students’ hint usage. We show empirical evidence to support that such a policy can save students a significant amount of time in training and lead to improved posttest results, when compared to a control without proactive interventions. We also show that incorporating students’ hint usage significantly improves the adaptive hint policy’s efficacy in predicting students’ HelpNeed, thereby reducing training unproductivity, reducing possible help avoidance, and increasing possible help appropriateness (a higher chance of receiving help when it was likely to be needed). We conclude with suggestions on the domains that can benefit from this approach as well as the requirements for adoption.","Adaptive support, Student modeling, Assistance dilemma, Unproductivity, Data-driven tutoring, Propositional logic",""

Alloy is one such language used for modeling systems early in the development process. Little work has been done to study the styles and techniques commonly used in Alloy models. We present the first static analysis study of Alloy models. We investigate research questions that examine a large corpus of 1,652 Alloy models. To evaluate these research questions, we create a methodology that leverages the power of ANTLR pattern matching and the query language XPath. Our research questions are split into two categories depending on their purpose. The Model Characteristics category aims to identify what language constructs are used commonly. Modeling Practices questions are considerably more complex and identify how modelers are using Alloy's constructs. We also evaluate our research questions on a subset of models from our corpus written by expert modelers. We compare the results of the expert corpus to the results obtained from the general corpus to gain insight into how expert modelers use the Alloy language. We draw conclusions from the findings of our research questions and present actionable items for educators, language and environment designers, and tool developers. Actionable items for educators are intended to highlight underutilized language constructs and features, and help student modelers avoid discouraged practices. Actionable items aimed at language designers present ways to improve the Alloy language by adding constructs or removing unused ones based on trends identified in our corpus of models. The actionable items aimed at environment designers address features to facilitate model creation. Actionable items for tool developers provide suggestions for back-end optimizations.","Computing and Processing, Metals, Analytical models, Data models, Software, Software development management, Libraries, Education, Declarative modeling, Alloy, static analysis",""

It can accurately evaluate the learning state of students and conduct personalized instruction according to the characteristics of different students. However, the current knowledge tracing models still have problems of inaccurate prediction results and poor features utilization. The study applies XGBoost algorithm to knowledge tracing model to improve the prediction performance. In addition, the model also effectively handles the multi-skill problem in the knowledge tracing model by adding the features of problem and knowledge skills. Experimental results show that the best AUC value of the XGBoost-based knowledge tracing model can reach 0.9855 using multiple features. Furthermore, compared with previous knowledge tracing models used deep learning, the model saves more training time.","Knowledge tracing, Deep learning, Multi-skill, XGBoost, Electronic computers.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and other technologies in recent years, there have been many breakthroughs in adaptive learning. Thus, it is important to gain insight into the evolution of related research and to track the research frontiers to further promote its development. This study used CiteSpace and VOSviewer to conduct a bibliometric analysis of 644 adaptive learning journal papers indexed in the WoS database from 2000 to 2022. This study presented a general view of the field of adaptive learning research over the last two decades using quantitative analysis. Currently, adaptive learning research is rapidly developing. In terms of the major research forces, a core group of authors including Qiao J. F., Han H. G. and Song Q has been formed; the major publishing country in this field is China; the core publishing journals include IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems. Four major research topics in this field were identified using cluster analysis, namely the application of deep learning in educational data analysis, the development and application of adaptive learning model in AI education, the development and application of intelligent tutoring system in tutoring and teaching, cutting-edge modeling technology for feature modeling and knowledge tracing. Through evolution analyses, the logic of adaptive learning research’s development was determined; that is, technological changes have played a key role in the development of this field. Following the logic, we presented three frontiers of adaptive learning with burst terms: feature extraction, adaptation model and computational modeling. Adaptive learning is a core research topic for both computer science and educational technology disciplines, and it is also an important field where emerging technologies empowering education and teaching can play a part. The findings of the study clearly presented the current research status, evolutionary logic and research frontiers of this topic, which can provide references for the further development of this research field.","adaptive learning, artificial intelligence, bibliometrics, intelligent technology, learning system, Environmental effects of industries and plants, TD194-195, Renewable energy sources, TJ807-830, Environmental sciences, GE1-350",""

We examine the possibility of using a student's browsing path during a learning session, based on his navigation traces, to update the learner model. We assume that the domain concepts examined outside the learning platform but that are related to the course concepts are problematic to the learner. Knowing about these concepts may allow the course's author to adapt the course to the learner's needs regarding these concepts, as well as allow the tutor to help and assist the learner on these problematic concepts. We rely on Web data mining methods to filter, organize, and analyze the student's browsing path.

We applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between eye-gaze features and students' learning performance. The obtained results suggest that combining eye-gaze tracking with learning traces and behaviour attributes may support an accurate prediction of students' learning performance.

Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), which try to tailor each user’s learning by adaptively scheduling problems depend upon learner modelling and the accurate prediction of learner performance to operate. ITSs have led to the availability of large-scale datasets enabling the development of richer models. The classical Bayesian approaches have been overtaken by faster, more scalable and more accurate models like DASH and DAS3H. Despite recent gains in prediction accuracy by NN based models, they are getting increasingly complex and computationally expensive. The issues with the scalability of recent models hinder their widespread adoption in Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) which outnumber ITSs by several magnitudes. NN models have very limited transferability. In this paper, the state-of-the-art approach involving Logistic Regression (LR) is examined on 8 public datasets and an alternative system based on variational encoding is presented. The proposed system outperforms the LR model in accuracy for 4 datasets. The new model is applied to the biggest Educational Data Mining (EDM) dataset available and shows that training on such a large dataset is possible without batching, which is not possible by other techniques. The paper focuses on the increase in scalability with a smaller memory footprint (requiring 22.5 ± 7.45 % less memory). The system also had a reduction in runtime for 5 among the 8 datasets. However, the variance in reduction is high with an average of $10.12\pm 21.55 \%$ reduced run times. The proposed system was developed specifically for lightweight MOOCs with limited Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Moodle. By estimating a learner ability parameter, the proposed system provides richer information to downstream applications like adaptive scheduling.

The main challenge of this task is how to decide which past problems are relevant for predicting performance on a future problem. This paper proposes a set of weighting schemes to address this challenge. Specifically, students' behaviors and performance on past problems were weighted in predicting performance on future problems. The weight of a past problem was proportional to its similarity with the future problem. Problem similarity was quantified in terms of source code, problem prompts, and struggling patterns. In addition, we considered another weighting scheme where past problems were weighted by the order in which students attempted them. Prior studies have used problem similarity and order information in learner modeling, but the proposed weighting schemes are more flexible in capturing problem similarity on various problem properties and weighting various behaviors and performance information on past problems. We systematically investigate the utility of the weighting schemes on performance prediction through two analyses. The first analysis found that the weighting schemes based on source code similarity, struggling pattern similarity, and problem order improved the prediction performance, but the weighting scheme based on problem prompts did not. The second analysis found that the weighting scheme allows a simple and interpretable model, such as logistic regression, to have performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep-learning models. We discussed the implications of the weighting schemes for learner modeling and suggested directions for further improvement.","Problem Solving; Introductory Courses; Computer Science Education; Programming; Models; Prediction; Performance; Decision Making; Regression (Statistics); Measurement Techniques",""

Despite the potential therapeutic benefits of primer vaccine dosage regimens, public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine booster dose (VBD) acceptance and hesitancy vary among various sub-group populations. This study investigates COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance and compares the multi-dimensional potential factors influencing VBD acceptance and hesitancy among university teachers and the student community in Bangladesh. Methods This web-based cross-sectional study employed an anonymous, validated, and self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire items were adopted from a theoretical analysis of the recent relevant literature. The questionnaire was deployed in an on-line-enabled format (Google form) and conveniently distributed to 685 teachers and 990 students between 15th June, 2022 and 15th August, 2022 which resulted in the participation of 1250 (505 teachers vs.745 students) total respondents (response rate 73.72% vs. 75.25%) from various universities in Bangladesh. A non-parametric analytical tool (binary logistic regression) was applied to rationalize the study objectives and a Chi-squared test was performed to estimate the booster- hesitant risky group. Results The pooled COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance rates were 84.6% (95% CI 81.5─87.7) and 67.2% (95% CI 63.8─70.6) for teachers and students in the university academic community, respectively. In employing a binary logistic regression, this study revealed that out of twelve (12)multi-dimensional key predictors, “equal safety”, “risk-benefit ratio”, and “variant control” had a significant positive association with VBD acceptance in both sets (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, and p = 0.005, respectively). Varied effects were found for several predictors; post-vaccination “side effects” had a significant negative association (p = 0.020) and “community protection” had significant positive association (p = 0.034) with vaccine booster dose acceptance in the teachers community while these variables were insignificant in the students cohort. “Trust” had a highly significant positive association (p = 0.000);“communication” and “academic attainment” had significant positive associations (p = 0.033 and 0.024, respectively) with VBD acceptance in the students cohort, while these predictors were insignificant in the teachers community. Women were more likely to receive a third dose of the vaccine (OR = 1.4 vs. 0.9 between teacher and student model); however, no significant association between gender and booster vaccine acceptance was found in a comparative Chi-squared model. Therefore, statistically, the booster vaccine-hesitant risky group was not found to implicate the massive booster vaccine drive among the university academic community. Conclusions COVID-19 booster vaccine acceptability among the student cohort was slightly lower than pre-roll-out intent. The teacher community was more inclined to get booster vaccinated. Moreover, differences were found between the multi-dimensional potential factors associated with VBD acceptance among teachers and students in university settings. This study explicitly confirmed positive attitudes toward the safety, health benefits, and variants control of the COVID-19 VBD under any circumstances. Post-vaccination side effect concern was found to be a barrier to administering booster shots and a reason for booster skepticism. Tailored communication and health education interventions need to be adopted to improve the public awareness of booster vaccine consequences, and limit booster skepticism.","Medicine, Science",""

Recent research has revealed the importance of drawings, talk, and gestures in students' model-based reasoning. This study provides further insight into the complementary role of these multimodal representations in student' model-based reasoning. The empirical basis constitutes sequences of students' interactive modeling during a laboratory exercise targeted toward the molecular mechanism behind diagnostic tests. The analytical procedure involves a social-semiotic analysis of students' drawings and microanalyses of the sequences of student interaction while engaging with this modeling activity. Our findings reveal a pattern in the use of these representations and provide insights into their roles in students' model-based reasoning. During three critical episodes in the students' modeling process, we show how drawings, deictic gestures, talk, and iconic gestures in a recurring pattern contributed to bringing students' meaning-making forward: drawings contributed to opening a creative space for their reasoning, while explorative talk together with iconic gestures became an important resource in exploring the aspects that were not shown in the drawing. We also show how the different representations took on different semiotic loads depending on where in the modeling cycle they were. We show how certain semiotic choices in the first drawing seem to support the students' model-based reasoning. Representing gestures became particularly important when the students revised and extended their models. These findings are discussed in relation to the different affordances of the various modes of representation.","Undergraduate Students; Biology; Dialogs (Language); Freehand Drawing; Nonverbal Communication; Thinking Skills; Modeling (Psychology); Semiotics; Abstract Reasoning; Interaction",""

The study's objective is to compare the strength of associations between standardized patient (SP) satisfaction with simulated genetic counseling sessions and student skill use during the sessions, as reported by SPs and students. We hypothesized that (1) Both SP- and student-reported skill use will be significantly associated with SP satisfaction ratings during the baseline simulation and (2): SP ratings of student skill use will show a stronger relationship to SP satisfaction than student self-rating of skill use. Sixty genetic counseling students and recent graduates (referred to as ""students"") from accredited U.S. and Canadian programs participated in the study and completed a baseline virtual-simulated genetic counseling session. Both students and SPs completed post-session questionnaires about communication skill use (a 22-item checklist) and SPs completed a satisfaction questionnaire based on the session (a 14-item Likert scale). Multilevel regression models assessed associations between SP satisfaction during the baseline session and SP- or student-reported skill use. SP satisfaction was significantly associated with skill use reported by both SPs and students, but the model based on SP report explained a higher proportion of the variance in SP satisfaction than student-reported skill use (SP model fixed effects R 2 = 27%, adjusted R 2 = 21%; vs. student model R 2 = 7%, adjusted R 2 = -2%). For both the SP and student models, use of more skills from the LISTEN domain (which focused on eliciting the patient's perspective) was associated with higher SP satisfaction, while other skill category domains were not. These findings support the SP satisfaction measure as sensitive to variation in student performance of key communication skills, especially those eliciting the patient's perspective. Moreover, SP assessment of session satisfaction can be a useful assessment of student communication performance and a meaningful proxy for actual patient satisfaction.

Knowledge tracing aims to model student knowledge state given the student’s sequence of learning activities. Modern Knowledge tracing (KT) is usually formulated as a supervised sequence learning problem to predict students’ future practice performance according to their past observed practice scores by summarizing student knowledge state as a set of evolving hidden variables. Because of this formulation, many current KT solutions are not fit f or modeling student learning from non-assessed learning activities with no explicit feedback or score observation (e.g., watching video lectures that are not graded). Additionally, these models cannot explicitly represent the dynamics of knowledge transfer among different learning activities, particularly between the assessed (e.g., quizzes) and non-assessed (e.g., video lectures) learning activities. In this paper, we propose Transition-Aware Multi-activity Knowledge Tracing (TAMKOT), which models knowledge transfer between learning materials, in addition to student knowledge, when students transition between and within assessed and non-assessed learning materials. TAMKOT is formulated as a deep recurrent multi-activity learning model that explicitly learns knowledge transfer by activating and learning a set of knowledge transfer matrices, one for each transition type between student activities. Accordingly, our model allows for representing each material type in a different yet transferrable latent space while maintaining student knowledge in a shared space. We evaluate our model on three real-world publicly available datasets and demonstrate TAMKOT’s capability in predicting student performance and modeling knowledge transfer.","",""

While in traditional personalization systems, student models representing the students’ current states of knowledge are hidden from students and used solely to personalize the educational process, OSLM gives students an opportunity to view, explore, compare peers, and even correct their own knowledge states. In this paper, we propose SmartMe, which is an online learning system for university-level programming algorithm courses, where students can practice exercises to improve their algorithm skills. The questions are presented in the form of multiple-choice questions, which each question links one or more targeted skills. There are two main modules in SmartMe, which are OSLM and case example recommender. The recommender aimed to find case examples based on their similarities with questions and student models. For this study, we applied a cosine similarity algorithm and webbing matrix. To measure the usability of the OSLM and case example recommender, both modules were evaluated by experts and students. The results show that 80.58% of participants found that the combination of OSLM and the case example recommender is useful.

One approach is to design an adaptive assessment path that helps learners achieve specific learning goals based on previous learner performance, level, and context.

As an educational resource, exercise plays an important role in students’ personalized learning service. Therefore, how to recommend appropriate exercises to students is a key problem to be solved urgently. The exercise recommendation method analyses students’ history answer sequences and provides personalized exercise recommendation service for students. Previous exercise recommendation methods assume that students’ knowledge states are fixed, so these methods cannot recommend exercise according to the changes of student ability. In addition, the existing methods do not take concept prerequisite relations into consideration. In this paper, we propose Exercise Recommendation method based on Knowledge Tracing and Concept Prerequisite relations (ER-KTCP). Firstly, ER-KTCP can capture the changes of students’ knowledge states. Secondly, ER-KTCP can adjust the details of recommendation strategy according to the changes of students’ knowledge states. Thirdly, ER-KTCP recommends exercises according to the relations between concepts and the difficulty of exercises, which makes selected exercises more reasonable. Besides, we propose a new metric to evaluate the improvement of student’s score after he has done the recommended exercises. Experiments on multiple data sets show that ER-KTCP performs better in exercise recommendation than state-of-the-art methods.","Exercise recommendation, Knowledge states, Knowledge tracing, Concept prerequisite relations, Personalized recommendation",""

In this paper, we examine students reading behavior using a digital textbook system while taking an open-book test from the perspective of engagement and performance to identify the strategies that are used. We create models to predict the performance and engagement of learners before the start of the assessment and extract reading behavior characteristics employed before and after the start of the assessment in a higher education setting. It was found that strategies, such as: revising and previewing are indicators of how a learner will perform in an open ebook assessment. Low performing students take advantage of the open ebook policy of the assessment and employ a strategy of searching for information during the assessment. Also compared to performance, the prediction of overall engagement has a higher accuracy, and therefore could be more appropriate for identifying intervention candidates as an early-warning intervention system.","Early warning prediction, Open-book assessment, Reading behavior, Student modeling",""

However, little is known as to what extent Facebook can promote learner autonomy among English as a foreign language (EFL) pre-service teachers (PSTs). This study explores the voices of EFL PSTs with regard to their use of Facebook as a tool for promoting their autonomy in learning English, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing upon Betts and Kercher’s (1996) Autonomous Learner Model (ALM), this study gained deeper insights into the EFL PSTs’ attitudes, perceptions, and ideas concerning the opportunities and challenges Facebook offers them. This qualitative study was based on a purposive sampling of twenty EFL PSTs from a university in northern Thailand. The findings reveal that Thai EFL PSTs experienced all five dimensions of ALM, namely, orientation, individual development, enrichment, seminars, and in-depth study. They also viewed learning English on Facebook positively during the lockdowns since they simultaneously acquired English and enjoyed edutainment resources despite some limitations concerning this platform. Pedagogical implications of this study suggest that Facebook is a suitable platform for ELT professional development and life-long learning, particularly amid the global disruption caused by COVID-19.","Learner autonomy, Facebook, Thai pre-service EFL teacher, Fanpage, COVID-19, Language and Literature, Philology.

Based on the collaborative filtering algorithm, the similarity of recommended resources is calculated, and the similarity between students' interests and the course is calculated; the recommendation algorithm of campus cultural education resources is designed, and the recommendation method of teaching resources is obtained. Comparing several different resource recommendation algorithms, it can be seen from the experimental data that when the similarity threshold is the same, the accuracy of the collaborative filtering method is the maximum among the three comparison methods, and the recall rate is the minimum. The average absolute error of the four algorithms can reach the minimum value when the similarity threshold is 0.3-0.4. At this time, the error value of the collaborative filtering method is 0.62, and the average absolute errors of the other two methods are 0.63 and 0.88, respectively.

Existing KT methods leverage students' online question-answering logs to infer their knowledge state and predict their subsequent performance.

Specifically, students have plenty of offline learning actions that also make changes in their knowledge state, which is called the offline knowledge evolution effect in this paper. However, these offline actions are not recorded by online learning systems, therefore leading to unreliable knowledge tracing results. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel model named offline-aware knowledge tracing (OKT) that considers students' offline knowledge evolution for KT. In O KT, we introduce a novel concept named offline trait to represent student's offline learning action preference. Based on the preference, the model evaluates offline knowledge evolution, and apply the evolution to generate a new knowledge state for students' future performance prediction.

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies.","bias, teachers, equity, artificial intelligence in education, learning analytics (LA), decision support systems, Electronic computers.

In this way, the EAKT not only can achieve an excellent prediction result of learning outcome but also can depict students’ knowledge state on a multi-dimensional knowledge component(KC) level. By performing the fine-grained analysis of the student learning process, the proposed framework provides better explanatory learner models for designing and implementing intelligent tutoring systems. The proposed EAKT is verified by experiments. The performance experiments show that the EAKT can better predict the future performance of student learning(more than 2.6% higher than the baseline method on two of three real-world datasets). The interpretability experiments demonstrate that the student knowledge state obtained by EAKT is closer to ground truth than other models, which means EAKT can more accurately trace changes in the students’ knowledge state.","Medicine, Science",""

However, it also faces problems such as information explosion and resource overload, which makes it difficult for learners to obtain personalized learning resources timely and accurately and to complete learning efficiently. Learning resource recommendation is one of the critical countermeasures to solve the above problem. The current recommendation of learning resources is mainly based on the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation method and content-based recommendation method, which do not fully consider learners' characteristics resulting in unsatisfactory effects. A collaborative filtering recommendation method for online learning resources is proposed based on a traditional collaborative filtering algorithm and combined with research in the learner modeling community. This method incorporates learners' characteristics and learning behaviors into recommendation calculations making the recommended learning resources better match learners' individual needs. This study implemented the proposed method based on an influential online teachers' professional development community in China.

Towards achieving this goal, we (i) formulate and evaluate multiple probabilistic graphical models to capture learner interest; (ii) identify and experiment with multiple probabilistic and ensemble approaches to combine interest, novelty, and knowledge representations together; and (iii) identify and experiment with different hybrid recommender approaches to fuse population-based engagement prediction to address the cold-start problem, i.e., the scarcity of data in the early stages of a user session, a common challenge in recommendation systems. Our experiments with an in-the-wild interaction dataset of more than 20,000 learners show clear performance advantages by integrating content popularity, learner interest, novelty, and knowledge aspects in an informational recommender system, while preserving scalability.

To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework to exploit the related external textual knowledge to assist the visual anticipation task. However, previous knowledge distillation techniques generally transfer information within the same modality. To bridge the gap between the visual and text modalities during the distillation process, we devise a novel cross-modal contrastive distillation (CCD) scheme, which facilitates knowledge distillation between teacher and student in heterogeneous modalities with the proposed cross-modal distillation loss.

Although the prediction accuracy has been improved by knowledge tracing models established on the basis of students' historical learning data, how to design and apply personalized learning recommendation by combining classroom teaching of higher education is a great difficulty. To recommend personalized learning resources meeting the teaching requirements in higher education, the Q-LRDP-D (Learning Resource Difficulty Prediction and Dijkstra based on Q matrix) algorithm was proposed in this study. First, learning resources were modeled in accordance with Q matrix theory. Then, students' learning difficulty was predicted through the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm of a learning resource difficulty prediction module, followed by cyclic prediction through combining the to-be-learned knowledge points as required by teaching units to form a directed path diagram of learning resources. Next, the least learning resources conforming to students' learning levels were recommended using the shortest path algorithm to complete learning tasks. Lastly, the accuracy and effectiveness of the established model were verified through undergraduate teaching experiments. Results demonstrate that the modeling of learning resources in higher education on the basis of Q matrix theory is applicable to the LSTM algorithm. In comparison with the benchmark algorithm, its precision is obviously improved. With the recommendation algorithm, the average return on learning resources in the experimental class is 6.31, which is considerably higher than that in the control group. This study provides a certain reference for improving students' learning efficiency through recommendation algorithms in higher education and teaching.

In this paper, we examine students reading behavior using a digital textbook system while taking an open-book test from the perspective of engagement and performance to identify the strategies that are used. We create models to predict the performance and engagement of learners before the start of the assessment and extract reading behavior characteristics employed before and after the start of the assessment in a higher education setting. It was found that strategies, such as: revising and previewing are indicators of how a learner will perform in an open ebook assessment. Low performing students take advantage of the open ebook policy of the assessment and employ a strategy of searching for information during the assessment.

This is because the previously learned superclass knowledge may be occupied by the sub-class knowledge learned sequentially. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MTKD) strategy. To preserve the subclass knowledge, we use the last model as a general teacher to distill the previous knowledge for the student model. To preserve the superclass knowledge, we use the initial model as a superclass teacher to distill the superclass knowledge as the initial model contains abundant superclass knowledge. However, distilling knowledge from two teacher models could result in the student model making some redundant predictions.

It aims at dynamically estimate students' knowledge status based on history answer records and predict whether they will answer the next question correctly. Predicting students' knowledge is a difficult task because student learning is a dynamic process and students' knowledge status is constantly changing. However, existing approaches often ignore the fact of students' stage development of learning ability and do not take into account the impact of short-term knowledge states on the next moment. Existing models do not emphasize the importance of students' long-term knowledge states and short-term knowledge states. In this paper, we propose a new Long- and Short-term Attention network Knowledge Tracing model (LSAKT). Specifically, we divided the sequences into subsequences based on time stamps, with the first attention layer learning the student's long-term knowledge state based on the interactional performance with the problem, while the other attention layer learns the student's short-term knowledge state based on the last sequence. Finally, we integrate the long-term knowledge state and the short-term knowledge state to form the student's final knowledge state. We evaluated the proposed model on four publicly available datasets, and the experimental results showed that the LSAKT approach achieved a fantastic result.","",""

Most of the existing knowledge tracing methods mainly considered the interaction sequence of learners, but they normally ignored the individual differences among learners. For example, learners with various levels of comprehension will behave differently when faced with new questions, which indicates that individual differences affect prediction accuracy. In addition, most learners learn only part of the concept, which leads to data sparsity. However, the existing methods do not solve the data sparsity well. In this paper, we are motivated to propose a Learner Profile-based Knowledge Tracing (LPKT) model, which uses learners' unique id and the features extracted from historical interaction sequences as learners' representation to model individual differences among learners. In addition, we establish relationships between concepts and utilize related concepts to augment the concept's representation to address the data sparsity. We conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, and the results show that our proposed LPKT model outperforms existing KT methods (with the highest AUC improvement of up to 8%).","",""

However, performance of such ASR system is inefficient for children speech, due to numerous acoustic variability in children speech and scarcity of resources. In this paper, we propose to use the unlabeled data extensively to develop ASR system for low resourced children speech. State-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 is the baseline ASR technique used here. The baseline’s performance is further enhanced with the intuition of Noisy Student Teacher (NST) learning. The proposed technique is not only limited to introducing the use of soft labels (i.e., word-level transcription) of unlabeled data, but also adapts the learning of teacher model or preceding student model, which results in reduction of the redundant training significantly. To that effect, a detailed analysis is reported in this paper, as there is a difference in teacher and student learning. In ASR experiments, character-level tokenization was used and hence, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss was used for fine-tuning. Due to computational limitations, experiments are performed with approximately 12 hours of training, and 5 hours of development and test data was used from standard My Science Tutor (MyST) corpus. The baseline wav2vec 2.0 achieves 34% WER, while relatively 10% of performance was improved using the proposed approach. Further, the analysis of performance loss and effect of language model is discussed in details.","",""

Knowledge tracing (KT) is aimed at tracking the cognition function of students according to their performance on various exercises at different times and has attracted considerable attention. Existing KT models primarily use bisection representations for the performance and cognitive states of students, thus limiting the application scope of these models and the accuracy of the evaluation of student cognitive performance in learning processes. Therefore, fuzzy Bayesian KT models (namely, FBKT and T2FBKT) are proposed to address continuous score scenarios (e.g., subjective examinations) so that the applicability of KT models may be broadened. Moreover, fine-grained cognitive states can be discerned. In particular, referring to type-2 fuzzy theory, T2FBKT mitigates the model uncertainty of FBKT induced by uncertain parameters. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy KT models.","Computing and Processing, Hidden Markov models, Bayes methods, Uncertainty, Cognition, Deep learning, Data models, Predictive models, Educational data mining, fuzzy theory, hidden Markov model (HMM), knowledge tracing (KT)",""

However, using the off-the-shelf models against fundus image datasets of different races may lead to degraded performance due to domain shift. To address the issue, this paper proposes a dual-tutor student learning network (DSLN) for multiracial glaucoma detection. The proposed DSLN consists of an inter-image tutor, an intra-image tutor, student model and backbone network, which combines the advantages of domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. The inter-image tutor uses CycleGAN for style transfer to reduce the appearance differences between labeled source domain and labeled target domain images, and transfers the learned knowledge to the student model by minimizing knowledge distillation loss. The intra-image tutor adopts the exponential moving average to leverage the unlabeled target domain and transfers the knowledge to the student model by minimizing prediction consistency loss. Moreover, the student model not only directly learns knowledge from the labeled target domain images, but also learns the intra-image knowledge and inter-image knowledge transfer by two tutors. Furthermore, the backbone integrates the context features of the local optic disc region and global fundus image via modified ResNet50. We conduct extensive experiments on three scenarios constructed from nine public fundus image datasets of three races. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed DSLN framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models and has good robustness and generalization: it can effectively overcome domain shift and accurately detect glaucoma from multi-ethnic fundus images.","Deep learning, Glaucoma detection, Multiracial fundus images, Dual-tutor student model, Domain shift",""

This study explores the voices of EFL PSTs with regard to their use of Facebook as a tool for promoting their autonomy in learning English, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing upon Betts and Kercher's (1996) Autonomous Learner Model (ALM), this study gained deeper insights into the EFL PSTs' attitudes, perceptions, and ideas concerning the opportunities and challenges Facebook offers them. This qualitative study was based on a purposive sampling of twenty EFL PSTs from a university in northern Thailand. The findings reveal that Thai EFL PSTs experienced all five dimensions of ALM, namely, orientation, individual development, enrichment, seminars, and indepth study. They also viewed learning English on Facebook positively during the lockdowns since they simultaneously acquired English and enjoyed edutainment resources despite some limitations concerning this platform. Pedagogical implications of this study suggest that Facebook is a suitable platform for ELT professional development and life-long learning, particularly amid the global disruption caused by COVID-19.

There are few attempts found in the literature to promote the development of students’ cognitive and metacognitive abilities in online learning environments. In addition, mechanisms for overcoming or reducing individuals’ anxiety in a computer-mediated environment is yet to be fully characterized. This study was conducted to investigate the potential of integrating the concept of flow into the design of a Metalearner (MTL) to help reduce anxiety and increase self-regulation among students. The design of MTL was based on the development of adaptive strategies to balance between the challenge of the task and user skills. A total of 260 participants were asked to use the system and respond to an online questionnaire that asked about flow antecedents, experience, and consequences. The structural model results showed that incorporating flow into the design of MTL can help reduce anxiety and improve self-regulation among students. Our findings can be used to enrich students’ online learning experience and inform designers and developers of learning systems about the importance of regulating task complexity according to the challenge/skills balance.

Existing research tends to focus on the identification of threshold concepts within undergraduate curricula as challenging concepts that prevent attainment of subsequent content until mastered. Recently, threshold concepts have likewise become a research focus at the level of doctoral studies. However, such research faces several limitations. First, the generalizability of findings in past research has been limited due to the relatively small numbers of participants in available studies. Second, it is not clear which specific skills are contingent upon mastery of identified threshold concepts, making it difficult to identify appropriate times for possible intervention. Third, threshold concepts observed across disciplines may or may not mask important nuances that apply within specific disciplinary contexts. The current study therefore employs a novel Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) approach to identify possible threshold concepts using a large data set from the biological sciences. Using rubric-scored samples of doctoral students’ sole-authored scholarly writing, we apply BKT as a strategy to identify potential threshold concepts by examining the ability of performance scores for specific research skills to predict score gains on other research skills. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy, as well as convergence between results of the current study and more conventional, qualitative results identifying threshold concepts at the doctoral level.","Threshold concepts, Bayesian knowledge tracing, Research training, Doctoral education",""

In this work, we propose a smarter mutual learning method called Smarter Peer Learning (SPL) for online knowledge distillation, which puts forward a weight evaluation mechanism to build a virtual teacher and a novel online distillation framework.

Despite the personalized learning afforded by ITSes using adaptive learning, learners are still susceptible to shallow learning. Introducing metacognitive tutoring to teach learners how to be aware of their knowledge can enable deeper learning. However, metacognitive tutoring on top of cognitive tutoring can lead to unsustainable cognitive loads. Using metacognitive inputs for knowledge tracing was explored for managing cognitive loads. Hidden Markov models (HMM) and artificial neural networks were used to train models on a synthetic dataset created from predetermined learner personas. The models created with metacognitive inputs were compared with the models created without said inputs. The models using metacognitive inputs performed better than the standard models while still following learning intuitions. This indicates that combining knowledge tracing and metacognitive tutoring is a viable option for improving learning outcomes. This is an important finding since online learning, which demands metacognitive skills, is becoming popular for various topics, including those that are challenging even with immediate teacher assistance.","knowledge tracing, hidden markov models, artificial neural networks, intelligent tutoring systems, metacognition, Education",""

This paper explores the predictive power and generalization of a feature - context-bound cognitive skill score- in estimating the likelihood of success or failure of a student in a traditional higher education course so that the appropriate intervention is provided to help the students. To identify the students at risk in different courses, we applied classification algorithms on context-bound cognitive skill scores of a student to estimate the chances of success or failure, especially failure. The context-bound cognitive skill scores were aggregated based on the learning objective of a course to generate meaningful visual feedback to teachers and students so that they can understand why some students are predicted to be at risk. Evaluation of the generated model shows that this feature is applicable in a range of courses, and it mitigates the effort in engineering features/models for each domain. We submit that overall, context-bound cognitive skill scores prove to be effective in flagging the student performance when the accurate metrics related to learning activities and social behaviors of the students are unavailable.

We explored these questions in ""Decimal Point,"" a digital learning game that teaches decimal numbers and operations to 5th and 6th graders, through a classroom study with 159 students and two versions of the game. One version encouraged playing and learning through an ""open learner model"" (OLM, N = 55), while one encouraged playing for enjoyment through an analogous ""open enjoyment model"" (OEM, N = 54). We compared these versions to a control version that is neutral with respect to learning and enjoyment (N = 50). While students learned in all three conditions, our results indicated no significant condition differences in learning outcomes, enjoyment, or engagement. However, the learning-oriented group engaged more in re-practicing, while the enjoyment-oriented group demonstrated more exploration of different mini-games. Further analyses of students' interactions with the open learner and enjoyment models revealed that students who followed the learner model demonstrated better in-game learning and test performance, while following the enjoyment model did not impact learning outcomes. These findings indicate that emphasizing learning or enjoyment can lead to distinctive game play behaviors, and that open learner models can be helpful in a learning game context. In turn, our analyses have led to preliminary ideas about how to use AI to provide recommendations that are more aligned with students' dynamic learning and enjoyment states and preferences.","Models; Learner Engagement; Computer Games; Educational Games; Mathematics Education; Elementary School Students; Mathematics Achievement; Artificial Intelligence; Arithmetic",""

To support these investigations, we present the Apprentice Learner Architecture, which posits the types of knowledge, performance, and learning components needed for apprentice learning. We use this architecture to create two models: the Decision Tree model, which non-incrementally learns skills, and the Trestle model, which instead learns incrementally. Both models draw on the same small set of prior knowledge (six operators and three types of relational knowledge) to support expert model authoring. Despite their limited prior knowledge, we demonstrate their use for efficiently authoring a novel experimental design tutor and show that they are capable of learning an expert model for seven additional tutoring systems that teach a wide range of knowledge types (associations, categories, and skills) across multiple domains (language, math, engineering, and science). This work shows that apprentice learner models are efficient for authoring tutors that would be difficult to build with existing non-programmer authoring approaches (e.g., experimental design or stoichiometry tutors). Further, we show that these models can be applied to author tutors across eight tutor domains even though they only have a small, fixed set of prior knowledge. This work lays the foundation for new interactive machine-learning based authoring paradigms that empower teachers and other non-programmers to build pedagogically effective educational technologies at scale.","Authoring tools, Intelligent tutoring systems, Interactive machine learning, Simulated agents",""

These models capture students’ learning interactions and store them in the form of a set of binary responses, thereby failing to utilize rich educational information in the learning process. Moreover, the recent development of these models has been focused on improving the prediction performance and tended to adopt deep neural networks in building the end-to-end prediction frameworks. Although this approach can provide an improved prediction performance, it may also cause difficulties in interpreting the student’s learning status, which is crucial for providing personalized educational feedback. To address this problem, this paper provides an interpretable cognitive model named HELP-DKT, which can infer how students learn programming based on deep knowledge tracing. HELP-DKT has two major advantages. First, it implements a feature-rich input layer, where the raw codes of students are encoded to vector representations, and the error classifications as concept indicators are incorporated. Second, it can infer meaningful estimation of student abilities while reliably predicting future performance. The experiments confirm that HELP-DKT can achieve good prediction performance and present reasonable interpretability of student skills improvement. In practice, HELP-DKT can personalize the learning experience of novice learners.","Medicine, Science",""

Furthermore, the study investigates whether a game’s aesthetics and mechanics support players’ intrinsic motivation. Both claims are tested through the design, implementation and pilot use of the Multiplication Game (MG). MG is a digital learning activity that supports pupils in achieving multiplication competence and provides teacher a dashboard to assess and watch own pupils’ performance. The game enriched with gamification elements to engage and motivate participants. Three versions of the game were used by pupils: without any Open Learner Modeling (OLM) support (i.e. without providing access to own progress data), with OLM support and with Open Social Learner Modeling (OSLM) support, to investigate the difference in motivation among these characteristics. After using the MG for a 2-month period, pupils answered a questionnaire anonymously to express their opinion about MG mechanics, MG aesthetics and intrinsic motivation MG can offer. Furthermore, the corresponding teachers were interviewed to provide insights on their attitude towards MG and its functionalities. A statistically significant difference in Intrinsic Motivation (IM) between the three different MG versions was found and a statistically significant difference in MG Aesthetics and Mechanics between the different grades of primary school. Additionally, Intrinsic Motivation was positively correlated with gamification motivators and MG Aesthetics. Participating teachers stated that MG can improve pupils’ multiplication competence and it is worthy of a stable place in the instructional procedure, as it is a means of pupils’ progress tracking and (self-) assessment, as well as a fun way of practicing and developing multiplication skills.","Digital game-based learning, Interactive learning environments, Media in education, Multiplication game, Open social learner modeling, Special aspects of education, LC8-6691",""

In essence, KD trains a smaller student model based on a larger teacher model and tries to retain the teacher model's level of performance as much as possible. However, existing KD methods suffer from the following limitations. First, since the student model is smaller in absolute size, it inherently lacks model capacity. Second, the absence of an initial guide for the student model makes it difficult for the student to imitate the teacher model to its fullest. Conventional KD methods yield low performance due to these limitations. In this paper, we propose Pea-KD (Parameter-efficient and accurate Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach to KD. Pea-KD consists of two main parts: Shuffled Parameter Sharing (SPS) and Pretraining with Teacher's Predictions (PTP). Using this combination, we are capable of alleviating the KD's limitations. SPS is a new parameter sharing method that increases the student model capacity. PTP is a KD-specialized initialization method, which can act as a good initial guide for the student. When combined, this method yields a significant increase in student model's performance. Experiments conducted on BERT with different datasets and tasks show that the proposed approach improves the student model's performance by 4.4% on average in four GLUE tasks, outperforming existing KD baselines by significant margins.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Deep Learning*, Learning*, Teaching*, Educational Personnel, Electronic Data Processing/methods, Humans, Language, Students",""

Could we use behavior patterns to build a data-driven model of individual differences that could be more useful for predicting critical outcomes of the learning process than traditional models? Our paper attempts to answer these questions using a large volume of learner data collected in an online practice system. We apply a sequential pattern mining approach to build individual models of learner practice behavior and reveal latent student subgroups that exhibit considerably different practice behavior. Using these models we explored the connections between learner behavior and both, the incoming and outgoing parameters of the learning process. Among incoming parameters we examined traditionally collected individual differences such as self-esteem, gender, and knowledge monitoring skills. We also attempted to bridge the gap between cluster-based behavior pattern models and traditional scale-based models of individual differences by quantifying learner behavior on a latent data-driven scale.

However, few attempts have been done to connect and compare behavioral patterns with known dimensions of individual differences. To what extent learner behavior is defined by known individual differences? Which of them could be a better predictor of learner engagement and performance? Could we use behavior patterns to build a data-driven model of individual differences that could be more useful for predicting critical outcomes of the learning process than traditional models? Our paper attempts to answer these questions using a large volume of learner data collected in an online practice system. We apply a sequential pattern mining approach to build individual models of learner practice behavior and reveal latent student subgroups that exhibit considerably different practice behavior. Using these models we explored the connections between learner behavior and both, the incoming and outgoing parameters of the learning process. Among incoming parameters we examined traditionally collected individual differences such as self-esteem, gender, and knowledge monitoring skills. We also attempted to bridge the gap between cluster-based behavior pattern models and traditional scale-based models of individual differences by quantifying learner behavior on a latent data-driven scale. Our research shows that this data-driven model of individual differences performs significantly better than traditional models of individual differences in predicting important parameters of the learning process, such as performance and engagement.","individual differences, learner modeling, sequential pattern mining, learning technology, online practice, SQL, Electronic computers.

Accordingly, we first present a framework, referred to as XAI-ED, that considers six key aspects in relation to explainability for studying, designing and developing educational AI tools. These key aspects focus on the stakeholders, benefits, approaches for presenting explanations, widely used classes of AI models, human-centred designs of the AI interfaces and potential pitfalls of providing explanations within education. We then present four comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of XAI-ED in four different educational AI tools.

We show how these concepts can be used in the design of OLMs, interfaces that enable a learner to see and interact with an externalised representation of their learning progress. We extend this important work by demonstrating how OLMs can also drive a learner-centred design process of learning data. We draw on the work of Biggs on constructive alignment (Biggs, 1996, 1999, 2011), which has been so influential in education. Like Biggs, we propose a way for teachers to design the learning data in their subjects and we illustrate the approach with case studies. We show how teachers can use this approach today, essentially integrating the design of learning data along with the learning design for their subjects. We outline a research agenda for designing the collection of richer learning data. There are three core contributions of this paper. First, we present the terms OLM, learner model, scrutability and ontologies, as thinking tools for systematic design of learning data. Second, we show how to integrate this into the design and refinement of a subject.

The study also discusses technical ontology use and the recommendation process. We identified multidisciplinary ontology-based recommender systems in 28 journal articles. These systems combined ontology with artificial intelligence, computing technology, education, education psychology, and social sciences. Student models and learning objects remain the primary ontology use, followed by feedback, assessments, and context data. Currently, the most popular recommendation item is the learning object, but learning path, feedback, and learning device could be the future considerations. This recommendation process is reciprocal and can be initiated either by the system or students. Standard ontology languages are commonly used, but standards for student profiles and learning object metadata are rarely adopted. Moreover, ontology-based recommender systems seldom use the methodology of building ontologies and hardly use other ontology methodologies. Similarly, none of the primary studies described ontology evaluation methodologies, but the systems are evaluated by nonreal students, algorithmic performance tests, statistics, questionnaires, and qualitative observations. In conclusion, the findings support the implementation of ontology methodologies and the integration of ontology-based recommendations into existing learning technologies. The study also promotes the use of recommender systems in social science and humanities courses, non-higher education, and open learning environments.","e-learning recommendation item, Learning object, Ontology-based recommender system, Ontology evaluation, Ontology methodology, Ontology use, Electronic computers.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, we generate synthetic data from a private dataset, and distribute it to the participants of a data challenge to train prediction models. Participants submitted their models as docker containers for evaluation and ranking on holdout synthetic data. A post-hoc analysis was conducted on the top 10 participant’s models by comparing the evaluation of their performance on synthetic and private validation datasets. Several models trained on synthetic data were found to perform significantly poorer when applied to the non-synthetic private dataset.

CQACD is based on constructivist principles and encourages the learner to construct knowledge rather than merely receiving knowledge, which has the following characteristics: (a) this system employs a domain ontology with rich semantic relationships to model the basic computer knowledge and build up a concept-centric knowledge model, (b) uses a limited number of 80 input templates with description logics to acquire the intention of questions posed by students, (c) a textual entailment algorithm with semantic technologies is proposed to match the input template and assess the student’s contribution to improve the flexibility of the system, and (d) an ontology-driven dialogue management mechanism is proposed, which can quickly form the conversational content and conversational sequence. The experimental results show that CQACD can replace the teachers’ tutoring in large classes and can promote the learning of poor students in large classes better than teachers can.

It can model CQAS’s discipline knowledge, provide structured domain knowledge for student model, template design and matching, and provide basic architectural architecture for dialogue management.","Dialogue-based ITSs, domain ontology, question-answering system, template logics, ontology learning, NLP, Electrical engineering.

In recent years, deep neural network-based approaches have been widely developed in KT and achieved promising results. More recently, several researches further boost these KT models via exploiting plentiful relationships including exercise-skill relations (E-S), the exercise similarity (E-E) as well as skill similarity (S-S). However, these relationship information are frequently absent in many real-world educational applications, and it is a labor-intensive work for human experts to label it. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing domain, we propose a novel pre-training approach, namely as SPAKT, and utilize self-supervised learning to pre-train exercise embedding representation without the need for expensive human-expert annotations in this paper.

CQACD is based on constructivist principles and encourages the learner to construct knowledge rather than merely receiving knowledge, which has the following characteristics: (a) this system employs a domain ontology with rich semantic relationships to model the basic computer knowledge and build up a concept-centric knowledge model, (b) uses a limited number of 80 input templates with description logics to acquire the intention of questions posed by students, (c) a textual entailment algorithm with semantic technologies is proposed to match the input template and assess the student’s contribution to improve the flexibility of the system, and (d) an ontology-driven dialogue management mechanism is proposed, which can quickly form the conversational content and conversational sequence.

More recently, several researches further boost these KT models via exploiting plentiful relationships including exercise-skill relations (E-S), the exercise similarity (E-E) as well as skill similarity (S-S).

EFDLS consists of a central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components: a feature-based student–teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. For each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its teacher’s hidden layers to its student’s hidden layers via knowledge distillation, where the teacher and student have identical network structures. For each connected user, its student model’s hidden layers’ weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the server, with the least square distance (LSD) used to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected user such that the user’s and its partner’s weights are the closest among all the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user’s and its partner’s weights to these two users which then load the received weights to their teachers’ hidden layers. Experimental results show that compared with a number of state-of-the-art federated learning (FL) algorithms, our proposed EFDLS wins 20 out of 44 standard UCR2018 datasets and achieves the highest mean accuracy (70.14%) on these datasets. In particular, compared with a single-task baseline, EFDLS obtains 32/4/8 regarding “win”/“tie”/“lose” and results in an improvement of approximately 4% in terms of mean accuracy.","Power, Energy and Industry Applications, Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems, Task analysis, Feature extraction, Heuristic algorithms, Servers, Multitasking, Time series analysis, Instruments, Data mining, deep learning, federated learning (FL), knowledge distillation, time series classification (TSC)",""

This student performance modeling problem is a critical step for building adaptive online teaching systems. Specifically, we conduct a study of how to utilize various types and large amounts of log data from earlier students to train accurate machine learning models that predict the performance of future students. This study is the first to use four very large sets of student data made available recently from four distinct intelligent tutoring systems. Our results include a new machine learning approach that defines a new state of the art for logistic regression based student performance modeling, improving over earlier methods in several ways: First, we achieve improved accuracy of student modeling by introducing new features that can be easily computed from conventional question-response logs (e.g., features such as the pattern in the student's most recent answers). Second, we take advantage of features of the student history that go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., features such as which video segments the student watched, or skipped) as well as background information about prerequisite structure in the curriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized student performance models for different aspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early versus later segments of the student history), then combine these specialized models to create a group prediction of the student performance. Taken together, these innovations yield an average AUC score across these four datasets of 0.808 compared to the previous best logistic regression approach score of 0.767, and also outperforming state-of-the-art deep neural net approaches. Importantly, we observe consistent improvements from each of our three methodological innovations, in each diverse dataset, suggesting that our methods are of general utility and likely to produce improvements for other online tutoring systems as well.","Academic Achievement; Electronic Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Predictor Variables; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Models; Elementary Secondary Education; Foreign Countries, South Korea; Taiwan; United Kingdom; China",""

This leads to a situation where ranking models is hard, and the underlying reasons of the models' performance -- be it architectural choices, hyperparameter tuning, performance metrics, or data -- is often underexplored. In this work, we review and evaluate a body of deep learning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models with openly available and widely-used data sets, and with a novel data set of students learning to program. The evaluated knowledge tracing models include Vanilla-DKT, two Long Short-Term Memory Deep Knowledge Tracing (LSTM-DKT) variants, two Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) variants, and SelfAttentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT). As baselines, we evaluate simple non-learning models, logistic regression and Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT). To evaluate how different aspects of DLKT models influence model performance, we test input and output layer variations found in the compared models that are independent of the main architectures. We study maximum attempt count options, including filtering out long attempt sequences, that have been implicitly and explicitly used in prior studies. We contrast the observed performance variations against variations from non-model properties such as randomness and hardware. Performance of models is assessed using multiple metrics, whereby we also contrast the impact of the choice of metric on model performance. The key contributions of this work are the following: Evidence that DLKT models generally outperform more traditional models, but not necessarily by much and not always; Evidence that even simple baselines with little to no predictive value may outperform DLKT models, especially in terms of accuracy -- highlighting importance of selecting proper baselines for comparison; Disambiguation of properties that lead to better performance in DLKT models including metric choice, input and output layer variations, common hyperparameters, random seeding and hardware; Discussion of issues in replicability when evaluating DLKT models, including discrepancies in prior reported results and methodology.

However, developing a skill model and tagging courseware contents with individual skills can be expensive and error prone. We propose a technology to automatically identify latent skills from instructional text on existing online courseware called SMART (Skill Model mining with Automated detection of Resemblance among Texts). SMART is capable of mining, labeling, and mapping skills without using an existing skill model or student learning (aka response) data. The goal of our proposed approach is to mine latent skills from assessment items included in existing courseware, provide discovered skills with human-friendly labels, and map didactic paragraph texts with skills. This way, mapping between assessment items and paragraph texts is formed. In doing so, automated skill models produced by SMART will reduce the workload of courseware developers while enabling adaptive online content at the launch of the course. In our evaluation study, we applied SMART to two existing authentic online courses. We then compared machine-generated skill models and human-crafted skill models in terms of the accuracy of predicting students' learning. We also evaluated the similarity between machine-generated and human-crafted skill models. The results show that student models based on SMART-generated skill models were equally predictive of students' learning as those based on human-crafted skill models--as validated on two OLI (Open Learning Initiative) courses. Also, SMART can generate skill models that are highly similar to human-crafted models as evidenced by the normalized mutual information (NMI) values.","Skills; Models; Identification; Courseware; MOOCs; Natural Language Processing; Data Analysis; Task Analysis; Program Evaluation; Automation",""

KT can be utilised to understand each student’s distinct learning style, particular needs, and ability levels. We trained and evaluated the performance of Knowledge Tracing models on the ASSISTments dataset and EdNet-KT1 dataset. This study revealed that deep learning models for knowledge tracing (Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN), and Attentive Knowledge Tracing (AKT)) outperform the Markov process model (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing).

Final year osteopathy students were assessed using a hybrid ten station OSCE, comprising both online and face-to-face components. The examination was led by a pre-recorded narrated PowerPoint video. The video contained instructions, case information for five cases and prompts for the practical stations. A student model stepped into the room as needed for practical stations. The examiner assessed students from another room via video streaming, with limited interaction with students. The hybrid OSCE was conducted safely during Stage 4 restrictions adhering to COVID Safe guidelines, allowing robust competency assessment of final year students, enabling timely graduation and transition to practice. Institutional support, technology infrastructure, clear communication and stakeholder collaboration are key to successful implementation. The hybrid OSCE format offers a potential solution for institutions delivering high-stakes assessment in the continuing challenges of clinical assessment in the post COVID landscape.

The purpose of this current study is to assess the preventive, supportive and awareness-building steps taken during the COVID-19 pandemic for international students in China, that will be useful for planning such a behavioral change campaign in the potential pandemic situation in other parts of the world.Methods: We conducted an online-based e-questionnaire survey among 467 international students in China through WeChat. The data collection duration was from February 20, 2020 to March 10, 2020 and we focused on their level of awareness, satisfaction, and trust in authorities regarding pandemic measures. Simple bivariate statistics was used to describe the background characteristics of the respondents along with adoption of the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) as the final model to demonstrate the relationship between the variables.Results: In our study, the leading group of the respondents were within 31 to 35 years’ age group (39.82%), male (61.88%), living single (58.24%) and doctoral level students (39.8%). The preventive and supportive measures taken by students and/or provided by the respective institution or authorities were positively related to students’ satisfaction and had an acceptable strength (β = 0.611, t = 9.679, p < 0.001). The trust gained in authorities also showed an acceptable strength (β = 0.381, t = 5.653, p < 0.001) with a positive direction. Again, the personnel awareness building related to both students’ satisfaction (β = 0.295, t = 2.719, p < 0.001) and trust gain (β = 0.131, t = 1.986, p < 0.05) in authorities had a positive and acceptable intensity. Therefore, our study clearly demonstrates the great impact of preventive and supportive measures in the development of students’ satisfaction (R2 = 0.507 indicating moderate relationship). The satisfied students possessed a strong influence which eventually helped in building sufficient trust on their institutions (R2 = 0.797 indicating above substantial relationship).Conclusions: The worldwide student group is one of the most affected and vulnerable communities in this situation. So, there is a profound ground of research on how different states or authorities handle such situation. In this study, we have depicted the types and magnitude of care taken by Chinese government and educational institutions towards international students to relieve the panic of pandemic situation. Further research and such initiatives should be taken in to consideration for future emerging conditions.","COVID-19, Awareness building, Epidemic, PLS-SEM, Supportive measures, Trust, international student, modeling",""

As an alternative to deep learning, BLS has gained extensive attention in data analytics. Unlike the existing deep structures based learning tools (such as deep neural networks), it is able to rapidly achieve incremental learning, and does not require tedious retraining to remodel the system. However, given image data modeling tasks, 1-D BLS requires a conventional vectorization operation, the dimension of input will be quite large for high resolution image. This operation may result in huge computational complexity, thereby increasing the time of model construction. To resolve this issue, a 2-D version of BLS, namely 2-D-BLS, is first proposed to fast construct randomized learner models by using matrix inputs. Specifically, the proposed method employs left and right projecting vectors to replace the usual high dimensional input weight. Moreover, the theoretical analyses on the superiority of 2-D-BLS against BLS are presented in terms of the algorithm complexity and the difference of random parameter space. Empirical results on MNIST dataset, NORB 3-D object image recognition dataset, ORL dataset, YaleB dataset, and handwritten digit dataset demonstrate that the proposed 2-D-BLS outperforms the existing extensions of BLS and state-of-the-art 2-D machine learning methods in terms of the learning efficiency, showing good potential of 2-D-BLS for image data analytics. Impact Statement —as a novel learning tool, BLS has achieved great success in many fields. Image recognition is one of the most widely used fields of artificial intelligence. But, BLS is a 1-D model, the vectorization operation is necessary to convert matrix input data into a row or a column vector. This operation will lead to “explosion of dimensionality” and increase the time of model construction when it is coming to image data analytic with 2-D input. This article first proposes a 2-D extension of BLS for high resolution image data analytic. The proposed method can not only avoid the “explosion of dimensionality,” but also construct the whole structure with matrix-inputs rapidly and dynamically. The improvement of this method is expected to provide a novel and great choice for the field of image recognition, such as face recognition, industrial inspection, behavior recognition, etc., in the future.","Computing and Processing, Data models, Data analysis, Computational modeling, Learning systems, Complexity theory, Training data, Broad learning system (BLS), data analytics, incremental learning, two-dimensional (2-D)",""

On the other hand, long-term motivation indicates a sort of continuing commitment that is required to complete assigned task. As short-term motivational problems span for a limited period of time, such as a session, therefore, they need to be addressed in real time to keep the learner engaged in the learning process. Similarly, long-term learners’ motivation plays an equally important role to retain the learner in the long run and minimize the risk of dropout. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to incorporate a comprehensive learner motivation model that is based on short-term and long-term aspects of the learners' motivation. This approach enables Web-based educational systems to identify the real-time motivational state of the learner and provide personalized interventions to keep the learners engaged in learning process. Design/methodology/approach Recent research regarding personalized Web-based educational systems demonstrates learner’s motivation to be an essential component of the learning model. This is because of the fact that low motivation results in either students’ less engagement or complete drop out from the learning activities. A learner motivation model is considered to be a set of perceptions and beliefs that the system has developed about a learner. This includes both short-term and long-term motivations of leaners. Findings This study proposed a framework of a domain independent learners’ motivation model based on firm educational theories. The proposed framework consists of two modules. The primary module deals with real-time identification of motivation and logging off activities such as login, forum participation and adherence to assessment deadline. Secondary module maintains the profile of leaners associated with both short-term and long-term motivation. A study was conducted to verify the impact of learners’ motivation model and personalized interventional strategies based on proposed model, using Systematical Information Education Method assessment standards. The results show an increase in motivational index and the characteristics associated with motivation during the conducted study. Originality/value Motivational diagnosis is important for both traditional classrooms and Web-based education systems. It is one of the major elements that contribute in the success of the learning process. However, dropout rate among online students is very high, which leads to incorporate motivational elements in more personalized way because motivated students will retain the course until they successfully complete it. Hence, identifying learner’s motivation, updating learners’ motivation model based on this identification and providing personalized interventions are the key for the success of Web-based educational systems.","research-article, Research paper, cat-IKM, Information & knowledge management, cat-ISYS, Information systems, cat-EDUN, Education, E-learning, Motivation model, Adaptation, Real-time learner modeling, Web-based education systems, Higher education, Modelling, Learning analytics, Adaptive system theory, Learning management systems",""

Educational technologies (e.g., learning analytics, student modelling, and intelligent tutoring systems) bring great potential to online education. Many online courses, particularly in self-paced online learning (SPOL), face some inherent barriers such as learning awareness and academic intervention. These barriers can affect the academic performance of online learners. Recently, learning analytics has been shown to have great potential in removing these barriers. However, it is challenging to achieve the full potential of learning analytics with the traditional online course learning design model. Thus, focusing on SPOL, this study proposes that learning analytics should be included in the course learning design loop to ensure data collection and pedagogical connection. We propose a novel learning design-analytics model in which course learning design and learning analytics can support each other to increase learning success. Based on the proposed model, a set of online course design strategies are recommended for online educators who wish to use learning analytics to mitigate the learning barriers in SPOL. These strategies and technologies are inspired by Jim Greer's work on student modelling. By following these recommended design strategies, a computer science course is used as an example to show our initial practices of including learning analytics in the course learning design loop.

Online writing support tools can scaffold writing development by providing this feedback, but existing systems provide inadequate support when instructors are inaccessible. In this paper, we show how feedback system design can leverage peer and automated feedback to support mature English Language Learners' (ELL) needs and practices. We identify strong associations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies, highlighting the importance of tasks that activate productive epistemic beliefs. We find learners accurately assessed high-level issues in a peer's writing and are accepting of automated feedback, demonstrating that a platform combining peer-review and machine feedback could promote meaningful discussions. We present the results of our mixed-methods investigation that integrates three sources of information: analysis of learners' psychometric constructs, writing samples to identify error patterns, and participatory design group sessions incorporating human-centred design methods. We synthesize our results into four guidelines derived from seven findings resulting from the investigation of a system that scaffolds writing development for mature immigrant ELLs in the absence of formal instructional support. First, we find that ELLs require a platform to collaboratively iterate through the writing process. Next, we suggest how peer feedback can be enhanced through automated support. We then demonstrate how rubric design can guide both linear and holistic peer-review. Finally, we illustrate why open learner models and learning dashboards should contextualize real world progress.

Growing research on formative assessment has shed light on the ways in which students' meaningful and in-situ learning experiences can be supported through educational games. To understand learners' playful experiences during gameplay, researchers have applied LA, which focuses on understanding students' in-game behaviour trajectories and personal learning needs during play. However, there is a lack of studies exploring how further research on LA in educational games can be conducted. Only a few analyses have discussed how LA has been designed, integrated, and implemented in educational games.

The proposed flexible model for organizing blended and distance learning in higher education involves the creation of an individual learning path through testing students before the start of training. Based on the learning outcomes, the student is credited to the learning path. The training path consists of mandatory and additional modules for training; additional modules can be skipped after successfully passing the test, without studying these modules. The paper examines the composition of intelligent learning systems: student model, learning model and interface model. A student model is described, which contains the level of their knowledge, skills and abilities, the ability to learn, the ability to complete tasks (whether they know how to use the information received or not), personal characteristics (type, orientation) and other factors. The student’s model is described by a mathematical formula.

This research presents a framework designed to foster students’ analysis skill in self-directed activities, which aims (1) to build a technology-enabled learning system allowing students to practice analyzing data from their own daily contexts, (2) to propose an approach to model student’s analysis skill acquisition level and process, and (3) to provide automated support and feedback for analysis skill development tasks.

By further analyzing students’ actual usage of the GOAL system, we found the actual activity levels and their preferences regarding analysis varied for the chosen contexts (learning and physical activity).

Programming has become an essential skill to solve realworld problems in modern engineering disciplines. However, when students start to learn how to program, they face a lot of challenges in acquiring various programming knowledge and skills. While it is beneficial to customise learning material to fit individual learning progress, the widely different learning pace of students in an introductory programming course has made it impractical for teachers to track the knowledge acquisition of individual. Hence, many recent works take a data-driven approach to model students' learning progress based on the performance data in programming-related exercises, which include the submitted program codes and answers to closed-ended programming exercises. By analyzing these performance data, a system can evaluate the students' knowledge level of various concepts and skills in programming. This paper performs a systematic review and reports key information about recent works on programming knowledge tracing based on student performance data. An overview of the different choices of knowledge representation, domain knowledge model, performance measure and knowledge tracing algorithms is provided. The nature and granularity of knowledge components and the relationships between them are compared across the reviewed works. The different choice of programming knowledge representation leads to varied methods to assess knowledge levels from empirical performance data in programming-related exercises. Two broad categories of works are identified. The first is to overlay a student model on the domain knowledge model, and the student knowledge levels are updated in distinct time steps. The second trains temporal knowledge tracing models to predict students' future performance based on their performance in previous exercises. In addition, this review discusses the distinct challenges in knowledge tracing in programming education. It also points out limitations in current works and opportunities to improve knowledge tracing in learning programming.","",""

Currently, lane detection relies on a huge amount of annotated images, which is a heavy burden. Active learning has been proposed to reduce annotation in many computer vision tasks, but no effort has been made for lane detection. Through experiments, we find that existing active learning methods perform poorly for lane detection, and the reasons are twofold. On one hand, most methods evaluate data uncertainties based on entropy, which is undesirable in lane detection because it encourages to select images with very few lanes or even no lane at all. On the other hand, existing methods are not aware of the noise of lane annotations, which is caused by heavy occlusion and unclear lane marks. In this paper, we build a novel knowledge distillation framework and evaluate the uncertainty of images based on the knowledge learnt by the student model. We show that the proposed uncertainty metric overcomes the above two problems. To reduce data redundancy, we explore the influence sets of image samples, and propose a new diversity metric for data selection. Finally we incorporate the uncertainty and diversity metrics, and develop a greedy algorithm for data selection. The experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art on the lane detection benchmarks. In addition, we extend this method to common 2D object detection and the results show that it is also effective.","",""

By combining linear self-attention with adaptive window size, EAKT enables the long-range modeling capability for long records and high window utilization for short records.

Student modelling plays a prominent role in many intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that address problem-solving domains. However, considerably less attention has been paid to using a student model to personalize instruction in tutorial dialogue systems (TDSs)—ITSs that engage students in natural-language, conceptual discussions. This paper describes Rimac, a TDS that tightly couples student modelling with tutorial dialogues about conceptual physics. Rimac is distinct from other TDSs insofar as it dynamically builds a persistent student model that guides reactive and proactive decision making in order to provide adaptive instruction. An initial pilot study set in high school physics classrooms compared a control version of Rimac without a student model with an experimental version that implemented a ""poor man's student model""; that is, the model was initialized using students' pretest scores but not updated further. Both low and high prior knowledge students showed significant pretest to posttest learning gains. However, high prior knowledge students who used the experimental version of Rimac learned more efficiently than high prior knowledge students who used the control version. Specifically, high prior knowledge students who used the student model driven tutor took less time to complete the intervention but learned a similar amount as students who used the control version. A subsequent study found that both high and low prior knowledge students learned more efficiently from a version of the tutor that dynamically updates its student model during dialogues than from a control version that included the static ""poor man's student model."" We discuss future work needed to improve the performance of Rimac's student model and to integrate TDSs in the classroom. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]","Intelligent tutoring systems, Tutors & tutoring",""

We proposed a weighted-based model to estimate and suggest learning materials for students who are pursuing a computer-based course. We have built a brand new ITS called WinITS with our proposed responsive student model and deployed it in Hanoi National University of Education-Vietnam (HNUE) in the second semester of the school year 2019-2020 with a computer science course. To compare the effectiveness of applying ITS to the students, we compare test results and analyze some other aspects related to the course. On the other hand, we conducted a survey between two groups: with and without using WinITS. 63 students are volunteers who participated in the case study. Before learning, 43 students from Group 1 will take a short survey of the Felder-Silverman questionnaire to identify learning styles, after that, they go through all the lessons from the course under the support of WinITS, the lessons will be chosen to satisfy student's need. On another side, 18 students from Group 2 will make the same test to compare the result to Group 1. In the range of research, we illustrate that our implementation shows some encouraging results such as reducing learning time, improving test score by 1.13 standard deviations, and making the lesson more interesting and flexible. The results have revealed some advantages of studying with computer-added compared to the traditional class in various ways and showed the effectiveness of the proposed model in Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

Although learning is individual, a model can be created based on patterns in student behavior. Since a student model can be created for more than one student, the use of machine learning techniques in student modeling is increasing. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which form one group of machine learning techniques, are among the methods most frequently used in learning environments. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are specific types of these networks, are used effectively for complex problems such as image processing, computer vision and speech recognition. In this study, a student model was created using a CNN due to the complexity of the learning process, and the performance of the model was examined. The student modeling technique used was named LearnerPrints. The navigation data of the students in a learning management system were used to construct the model.

Analysis skill for self-directed activities requires the students to analyze their own activity data for understanding their status in that activity. It is an important phase that determines whether an appropriate plan can be set or not. This research presents a framework designed to foster students’ analysis skill in self-directed activities, which aims (1) to build a technology-enabled learning system allowing students to practice analyzing data from their own daily contexts, (2) to propose an approach to model student’s analysis skill acquisition level and process, and (3) to provide automated support and feedback for analysis skill development tasks. The analysis module based on the proposed framework was implemented in the GOAL system which synchronized data from learners’ physical and reading activities. A study was conducted with 51 undergraduate students to find reliable indicators for the model to then measure students’ analysis skills. By further analyzing students’ actual usage of the GOAL system, we found the actual activity levels and their preferences regarding analysis varied for the chosen contexts (learning and physical activity). The different context preference groups were almost equal, highlighting the utility of a system that integrates data from multiple contexts. Such a system can potentially respond to students’ individual preferences to execute and acquire self-direction skill.","Data analysis, Self-directed learning, Self-direction skill, Skill measurement, Automated measurement, Student modeling, Information technology, T58.5-58.64, Education",""

Its success is generally attributed to the privileged information on similarities/consistency between the class distributions or intermediate feature representations of the teacher model and the student model. However, directly pushing the student model to mimic the probabilities/features of the teacher model to a large extent limits the student model in learning undiscovered knowledge/features. In this paper, we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework (IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts - inheritance and exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model, while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance. Furthermore, by applying our IE-KD to the training of two networks, the performance of both can be improved w.r.t. deep mutual learning.","",""

Empirical studies have verified that the learner models produced by SCNs can usually achieve favorable test performance in practice but more in-depth theoretical analysis of their generalization power would be useful for constructing SCN-based ensemble models with enhanced generalization capacities. In particular, given a collection of independently developed SCN-based learner models, it is useful to select certain base learners that can potentially obtain preferable test results rather than considering all of the base models together, before simply taking their average in order to build an effective ensemble model. In this study, we propose a novel framework for building SCN ensembles by exploring key factors that might potentially affect the generalization performance of the base model. Under a mild assumption, we provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for examining a learner model's generalization error, as well as formulating a novel indicator that contains measurement information for the training errors, output weights, and a hidden layer output matrix, which can be used by our proposed algorithm to find a subset of appropriate base models from a pool of randomized learner models. A toy example of one-dimensional function approximation, a case study for developing a predictive model for forecasting student learning performance, and two large-scale data sets were used in our experiments.

Virtual patient simulators (VPSs) may partially meet these needs. Natural language processing (NLP) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) may further enhance the educational impact of these simulators.; Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a VPS for clinical diagnostic reasoning that integrates interaction in natural language and an ITS. We also aimed to provide preliminary results of a short-term learning test administered on undergraduate students after use of the simulator.; Methods: We trained a Siamese long short-term memory network for anamnesis and NLP algorithms combined with Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology for diagnostic hypothesis generation. The ITS was structured on the concepts of knowledge, assessment, and learner models. To assess short-term learning changes, 15 undergraduate medical students underwent two identical tests, composed of multiple-choice questions, before and after performing a simulation by the virtual simulator. The test was made up of 22 questions; 11 of these were core questions that were specifically designed to evaluate clinical knowledge related to the simulated case.; Results: We developed a VPS called Hepius that allows students to gather clinical information from the patient's medical history, physical exam, and investigations and allows them to formulate a differential diagnosis by using natural language. Hepius is also an ITS that provides real-time step-by-step feedback to the student and suggests specific topics the student has to review to fill in potential knowledge gaps. Results from the short-term learning test showed an increase in both mean test score (P<.001) and mean score for core questions (P<.001) when comparing presimulation and postsimulation performance.; Conclusions: By combining ITS and NLP technologies, Hepius may provide medical undergraduate students with a learning tool for training them in diagnostic reasoning. This may be particularly useful in a setting where students have restricted access to clinical wards, as is happening during the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries worldwide.

Therefore, emotion recognition is becoming very relevant in educational scenarios, but there is no standard method for predicting students' affects.

This is achieved by the technology of student modeling. One prevalent technique of student modeling is stereotypes. Furthermore, individuals differ in how they learn. So, the way that helps an individual to learn best is crucial for offering her/him an effective tutoring experience. As a consequence, students' preferable styles of learning should be incorporated into the student model. However, some researchers have concluded that there are individuals that have a mixture of learning styles. That is the reason for the combination of two different learning style models in the presented approach. Particularly, in this paper we present a stereotype student model that combines the Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing and Kinesthetic (VARK) learning style model and the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI). The aim of this article is to further enhance the personalization to students' needs and preferences by introducing this hybrid instrument and using the technology of stereotypes. The gain from this hybrid learning style approach is that we model two different dimensions of the way that a student prefers to learn: i) the sensory modalities of learning and ii) the way of thinking. In this way, the offered tutoring process can be more tailored to each individual student's needs, respecting the distinct pace of her/his learning. Our novel approach has been incorporated in an e-learning system and was evaluated by 60 undergraduate students in Greece. The evaluation results show a great acceptance rate of the novel hybrid learning style model by students and underline its pedagogical potential.

The primary purpose of this modeling is to extract user characteristics in order to personalize the learning process based on learners’ needs, learning style, personality, and individual circumstances. Methods: The present study provides a review of published literature over the past 20 years in academic databases including IEEE, Sciencedirect, Wiley, and Springer. The search was limited to the studies on the personalization of e-learning environments based on learner characteristics, specifically the ones providing a reliable method for integrating these characteristics, as appropriate input variables, in the design of personalized e-learning systems. Results: This study proposed a new method of classifying the learner characteristics as the variables for designing a personalized e-learning system. A total of 111 papers were considered for analysis. In the end, 22 influential learner characteristics were extracted and classified into six subcategories, namely cognitive, motivational, behavioral, emotional, metacognitive aspects, and combined domains. The proposed classification method was also compared with available related categorizations to demonstrate this method’s advantage in designing a personalized e-learning environment. Conclusion: The findings represent the learning criteria that can be utilized in designing adaptive learning systems. Moreover, it can also aid other researchers in this field to achieve a better perspective in learner modeling.

Predictive student models use trace data extracted from students' in-game learning behaviors to unobtrusively generate early assessments of student knowledge and skills, equipping game-based learning environments with the capacity to anticipate student outcomes and proactively deliver adaptive scaffolding or notify instructors. Reflection is a key component of self-regulated learning, and it is critical in effective learning. However, there is currently limited work exploring the utility of reflection for inducing accurate predictive student models. This article presents a predictive student modeling framework that leverages natural language responses to in-game reflection prompts to predict student learning outcomes in a game-based learning environment for middle school microbiology, CRYSTAL ISLAND. With data from a pair of classroom studies involving 118 middle school students, we investigate the accuracy of early prediction models that utilize features extracted from student trace data combined with word embedding-based representations (i.e., GloVe, ELMo) of student reflection responses. We evaluate the accuracy of the predictive models over time using data from incremental segments of each student's interaction with the game-based learning environment, and we compare against models that omit student reflection features. Results reveal that models encoding students' natural language reflections with ELMo word embeddings yield significantly improved accuracy compared to other representations, with the greatest accuracy demonstrated by an ensemble of predictive models. We discuss the implications of these results for the design of game-based learning environments.

The development of education informatization has led to a rapid increase in the number of online learning users and an explosion in the number of learning resources, which makes learners face the dilemma of “information overload” and “learning lost” in the learning process. In the personalized learning resource recommendation system, the most critical thing is the construction of the learner model. Currently, most learner models generally have a lack of scientific focus that they have a single method of obtaining dimensions, feature attributes, and low computational complexity. These problems may lead to disagreement between the learner’s learning ability and the difficulty of the recommended learning resources and may lead to the cognitive overload or disorientation of learners in the learning process. The purpose of this paper is to construct a learner model to support the above problems and to strongly support individual learning resources recommendation by learning the resource model which effectively reduces the problem of cold start and sparsity in the recommended process. In this paper, we analyze the behavioral data of learners in the learning process and extract three features of learner’s cognitive ability, knowledge level, and preference for learning of learner model analysis.

However, existing works ignore the impact of learning transfer on knowledge tracing and only track knowledge proficiency. Knowledge proficiency alone cannot fully reflect students’ knowledge mastery levels. A student’s knowledge structure (the similarities and differences within knowledge concepts) and abstract principle mastery level (common attributes among knowledge concepts, such as learning methods) also need to be tracked. To this end, we propose a novel multilevel Knowledge Tracing model with Learning Transfer (KTLT) to track students’ knowledge mastery levels. First, we clarify the relationships among abstract principles, knowledge structure, and knowledge proficiency by utilizing the learning transfer theory in educational psychology. Then, we associate each problem with a knowledge vector in which each element represents an explicit knowledge concept by leveraging educational priors (i.e., a Q-matrix). Correspondingly, each student is represented as a knowledge vector (knowledge proficiency) and an abstract principle vector (abstract principle mastery). Given a student’s knowledge and abstract principle vector over time, we use the learning and forgetting curve as priors to capture the student’s knowledge proficiency and abstract principle mastery level over time. Furthermore, we embed the knowledge concept by using a student’s abstract principle mastery level and obtain a personalized knowledge relevance matrix (a student’s knowledge structure) by calculating the cosine similarity among the knowledge embedding results. Finally, we design a probabilistic matrix factorization framework by combining student and problem priors for tracking a student’s knowledge mastery. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and explanatory ability of the KTLT.","Knowledge tracing, learning transfer, data mining, education priors, dynamic modeling, probability graph model, Electrical engineering.

As the main contribution of this paper, our proposed multi-teacher KD paradigm endows the student with the ability to amalgamate and capture a variety of knowledge illustrations from different sources. Results demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing studies on both clean and corrupted data in the semantic segmentation task while benefiting from our proposed score weight system. Experiments validate that our multi-teacher framework results in an improvement of 9% up to 32.18% compared to the single-teacher paradigm. Moreover, it is demonstrated that our paradigm surpasses previous supervised real-time studies in the semantic segmentation challenge.","Autonomous vehicles, convolutional neural networks, knowledge distillation, semantic segmentation, semi-supervised learning, corruption robustness, Electrical engineering.

Despite their remarkable performance improvements, end-to-end models typically require expensive computational cost to show successful performance. To reduce this computational burden, knowledge distillation (KD), which is a popular model compression method, has been used to transfer knowledge from a deep and complex model (teacher) to a shallower and simpler model (student). Previous KD approaches have commonly designed the architecture of the student by reducing the width per layer or the number of layers of the teacher. This structural reduction scheme might limit the flexibility of model selection since the student model structure should be similar to that of the given teacher. To cope with this limitation, we propose a KD method for end-to-end speech recognition, namely TutorNet, that applies KD techniques across different types of neural networks at the hidden representation-level as well as the output-level. For concrete realizations, we firstly apply representation-level knowledge distillation (RKD) during the initialization step, and then apply the softmax-level knowledge distillation (SKD) combined with the original task learning. When the student is trained with RKD, we make use of frame weighting that points out the frames to which the teacher pays more attention. Through a number of experiments, it is verified that TutorNet not only distills the knowledge between networks with different topologies but also significantly contributes to improving the performance of the distilled student.","Signal Processing and Analysis, Computing and Processing, Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies, General Topics for Engineers, Computational modeling, Hidden Markov models, Speech recognition, Training, Knowledge engineering, Speech processing, Task analysis, connectionist temporal classification, knowledge distillation, teacher-student learning, transfer learning",""

In this paper, we compare two AutoML feature engineering methods in the context of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data mining competition. The methods we compare, Featuretools and TSFRESH (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests), have rarely been applied in the context of student interaction log data. Thus, we address research questions regarding the accuracy of models built with AutoML features, how AutoML feature types compare to each other and to expert-engineered features, and how interpretable the features are. Additionally, we developed a novel feature selection method that addresses problems applying AutoML feature engineering in this context, where there were many heterogeneous features (over 4,000) and relatively few students. Our entry to the NAEP competition placed 3rd overall on the final held-out dataset and 1st on the public leaderboard, with a final Cohen's kappa = 0.212 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.665 when predicting whether students would manage their time effectively on a math assessment. We found that TSFRESH features were significantly more effective than either Featuretools features or expert-engineered features in this context; however, they were also among the most difficult features to interpret based on a survey of six experts' judgments. Finally, we discuss the tradeoffs between effort and interpretability that arise in AutoML-based student modeling.","Accuracy; Learning Analytics; Models; National Competency Tests; Comparative Analysis; Data Analysis; Hypothesis Testing; Computer Software; Competition; Specialists; Decision Making; Evaluators; Prediction; Time Management; Mathematics Tests; Grade 4; Grade 8, National Assessment of Educational Progress",""

By personalizing the temporal distribution of retrieval practice of a given piece of knowledge, they improve learners' long-term memory retention compared to fixed review schedules. However, such algorithms are generally designed for the pure memorization of single items, such as vocabulary words. Yet, the spacing effect has been shown to extend to more complex knowledge, such as the practice of mathematical skills. In this article, we extend three adaptive spacing heuristics from the literature for selecting the best skill to review at any timestamp given a student's past study history. In real-world educational settings, items generally involve multiple skills at the same time. Thus, we also propose a multi-skill version for two of these heuristics: instead of selecting one single skill, they select with a greedy procedure the most promising subset of skills to review. To compare these five heuristics, we develop a synthetic experimental framework that simulates student learning and forgetting trajectories with a student model. We run multiple synthetic experiments on large cohorts of 500 simulated students and publicly release the code for these experiments. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each heuristic in terms of performance, robustness, and complexity. Finally, we find evidence that selecting the best subset of skills yields better retention compared to selecting the single best skill to review.","Heuristics; Time Factors (Learning); Memorization; Time Management; Repetition; Skill Development; Selection; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Uses in Education; Mastery Learning",""

In SRL, monitoring plays a critical role in generating internal feedback and thus adopting appropriate regulations. However, students may have poor SRL processes and performance due to their poor monitoring. Researchers have suggested providing external feedback to facilitate better student SRL. However, SRL involves many meta-cognitive internal processes that are hidden and difficult to observe and measure. This study proposed a SRL model to illustrate the relationship among external SRL tools, internal SRL processes, internal feedback, and external feedback. Based on the model, this study designed a system with SRL tools and open leaner models (OLMs) to assist students in conducting SRL, including self-assessing their initial learning performance (i.e. perceived initial performance and monitoring of learning performance) after listening to a teacher’s lecture, being assessed by and receiving external feedback from the OLM (i.e. actual performance) in the system, setting target goals (i.e. desired performance) of follow-up learning, conducting follow-up learning (i.e. strategy implementation), and evaluating their follow-up learning performance (i.e. perceived outcome performance and strategy outcome monitoring). These SRL tools also externalize students’ internal SRL processes and feedback, including perceived initial, desired, and perceived outcome performances, for investigation. In addition, this study explores the impact of external feedback from the OLM on students’ internal SRL processes and feedback. An evaluation was conducted to record and analyze students’ SRL processes and performance, and a questionnaire was administered to ask students about their SRL processes. There are three main findings. First, the results showed that students often have poor internal SRL processes and poor internal feedback, including poor self-assessment, inappropriate target goals, a failure to conduct follow-up learning, and a failure to achieve their goals. Second, the results revealed that the SRL tools and external feedback from the OLM assisted most students in SRL, including monitoring their learning performance, goal-setting, strategy implementation and monitoring, and strategy outcome monitoring. Third, some students still required further support for SRL.","Self-regulated learning, Computer tools, Internal feedback, External feedback, Open learner model, Special aspects of education, LC8-6691, Information technology, T58.5-58.64",""

To solve these issues, we propose herein a novel model, called the knowledge interaction-enhanced knowledge tracing (KIKT), to estimate and trace the evolution of learners' KP. We first propose a framework by unifying the strength of the memory network to enhance the representation of the knowledge state and the interpretability of the Item Response Theory to explain learner performance. In this framework, we trace each learner's KP on each knowledge concept overtime, and further infer their proficiencies and the item characteristics using two kinds of neural networks.

Much attention has been drawn to this area and several works such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Deep Knowledge Tracing are proposed. Recent works have explored the value of relations among concepts and proposed to introduce knowledge structure into KT task. However, the propagated influence among concepts, which has been shown to be a key factor in human learning by the educational theories, is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Structure-based Knowledge Tracing (SKT), which exploits the multiple relations in knowledge structure to model the influence propagation among concepts. In the SKT framework, we not only consider the temporal effect on the exercising sequence but also take the spatial effect on the knowledge structure into account. We take advantages of two novel formulations in modeling the influence propagation on the knowledge structure with multiple relations. For undirected relations such as similarity relations, the synchronization propagation method is adopted, where the influence propagates bidirectionally between neighbor concepts. For directed relations such as prerequisite relations, the partial propagation method is applied, where the influence can only unidirectionally propagate from a predecessor to a successor. Meanwhile, we employ the gated functions to update the states of concepts temporally and spatially. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of SKT.","",""

Although students believe that highlighting and subsequent review of the highlights will further their educational goals, the psychological literature provides little evidence of benefits. Nonetheless, a student's choice of text for highlighting may serve as a window into her mental state-her level of comprehension, grasp of the key ideas, reading goals, and so on. We explore this hypothesis via an experiment in which 400 participants read three sections from a college-level biology text, briefly reviewed the text, and then took a quiz on the material. During initial reading, participants were able to highlight words, phrases, and sentences, and these highlights were displayed along with the complete text during the subsequent review. Consistent with past research, the amount of highlighted material is unrelated to quiz performance. Nonetheless, highlighting patterns may allow us to infer reader comprehension and interests. Using multiple representations of the highlighting patterns, we built probabilistic models to predict quiz performance and matrix factorization models to predict what content would be highlighted in one passage from highlights in other passages. We find that quiz score prediction accuracy reliably improves with the inclusion of highlighting data (by about 1%-2%), both for held-out students and for held-out student questions (i.e., questions selected randomly for each student), but not for held-out questions. Furthermore, an individual's highlighting pattern is informative of what she highlights elsewhere. Our long-term goal is to design digital textbooks that serve not only as conduits of information into the reader's mind but also allow us to draw inferences about the reader at a point where interventions may increase the effectiveness of the material.

Generally, the knowledge construction procedure is constantly evolving because students dynamically learn and forget over time. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge most existing approaches consider only a fragment of the information that relates to learning or forgetting, and the problem of making use of rich information during learners’ learning interactions to achieve more precise prediction of learner performance in KT remains under-explored. Moreover, existing work either neglects the problem difficulty or assumes that it is constant, and this is unrealistic in the actual learning process as problem difficulty affects performance undoubtedly and also varies overtime in terms of the cognitive challenge it presents to individual learners. To this end, we herein propose a novel model, KTM-DLF (Knowledge Tracing Machine by modeling cognitive item Difficulty and Learning and Forgetting), to trace the evolution of each learner’s knowledge acquisition during exercise activities by modeling his or her dynamic knowledge construction procedure and cognitive item difficulty. Specifically, we first specify the concept of cognitive item difficulty and propose a method to model the cognitive item difficulty adaptively based on learners’ learning histories. Then, based on two classical theories (the learning curve theory and the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve theory), we propose a method for modeling learners’ learning and forgetting over time. Finally, the KTM-DLF model is proposed to incorporate learners’ abilities, the cognitive item difficulty, and the two dynamic procedures (learning and forgetting) together. We then use the factorization machine framework to embed features in high dimensions and model pairwise interactions to increase the model’s accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three public real-world datasets, and the results confirm that our proposed model outperforms the other state-of-the-art educational data mining models.","Knowledge tracing, Learner modeling, Knowledge construction procedure, Cognitive item difficulty, Learning and forgetting",""

However, these sources of data are not easy to utilize and are often used in an ad hoc fashion. We propose to use answer classification as an interface between raw data about student performance and algorithms for adaptive behavior. Specifically, we propose a classification of student answers into six categories: three classes of correct answers and three classes of incorrect answers. The proposed classification is broadly applicable and makes the use of additional interaction data much more feasible.

A novel metric, the approaching index, was developed using the tree edit distance in abstract syntax trees to measure the similarities between the learners' intermediate solutions and the optimal solution. The proposed method allows for each learner's programming path to be represented as a raw approaching index sequence (AISeq) or as a single variable (AIScore) by averaging the AISeq. A logistic regression model was first designed to predict the learners' performances using their AIScore, the number of attempts, and their current performance. A second model, a recurrent neural network model, was also developed to directly use the AISeq and to make predictions. To verify the effectiveness of these models, a series of statistical analyses and experiments were conducted on two existing large-scale block-based programming datasets, the results from which revealed that the proposed models were competitive with four state-of-the-art models on multiple metrics, such as the precision-recall curve, accuracy, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa.

Artificial intelligence has begun to be used in medical education, which consists of enormously complex information and which continues throughout life. Cognitive psychology revealed that knowledge is best remembered when it is taught in a way that it can be used, practiced and evaluated. In this context, artificial intelligence applications can be useful in clinical reasoning, as well as assessment and evaluation in medical education. In addition, ""smart educational systems"" that enable students to receive personalized education as a result of measuring their learning levels are also promising. Here, in the light of current national and international publications, the latest developments in the field of medicine and pathology are presented. Articles in English in international large medical databases, Pubmed and Medline Complete, and national Turkish publications in ULAKBİM and DergiPark databases published between January 2000 and July 2020 are searched for analysis.

Though publications on the use of artificial intelligence in medical education in international databases have been increasing in recent years, they are still very scarce. As a result of the literature review, 37 publications are found, 32 of which are about the use of artificial intelligence in the field of learning in medical education, 4 on the use of assessment and evaluation, and 1 on curriculum analysis and development. Examples of artificial intelligence applications in medical education so far include virtual patient simulator projects such as ATTENDING, GUIDON, TeachMed and TOUCH, etc., virtual reality surgery simulation applications, robot simulated patient applications, chatbot /teacherbot applications and wearable sensors. Although there are no publications on the use of artificial intelligence in pathology education, we think that it can be used in student learning and evaluation. Thus, projects can be developed in the fields of macroscopy / autopsy training, creating chatbots and creating case-based digital microscopy platforms. Technical problems (difficulty in developing models, difficulty in creating content, inadequate doctor-engineer cooperation, etc.) and doubts about whether it will work (difficulties in evaluating its effectiveness, having a narrow application range, etc.) are some of the obstacles related to the development of artificial intelligence applications in medical education. In order for these applications to be successful, it is necessary to take into account the issues such as current educational theories and pedagogical information, student modeling and institutional planning. The most effective results can be achieved through teamwork in which medicine, education, computer experts and students are together during design. It is clear that artificial intelligence will be used more frequently in the fields of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment in medicine in the near future. Training of medical students with a curriculum where they can see and comprehend artificial intelligence applications and experience them in their own education will enable them to be more prepared and equipped for the future.

We found that the new educational process design reflects the emerging trend of the “anthropological transition” in science, which is associated with the emergence of free access to knowledge and responsible attitude to the knowledge application. It is shown that the content design of university educational (and training) programs should be oriented toward the independent design of personalized learning by a student. This idea involves the appeal to personal experiences of teachers and students as a core of educational content affecting all its components by designing an individual student model of educational content expressed in the formed individual set of key competencies of a particular student. We established that the proposed approach to the design of the new educational process is founded on the content design based on the ideas of humanitarian design, determining the probabilistic nature of dynamic learning models design. The term “probabilistic” reflects the uncertainty of pedagogical systems, the dependence of ongoing pedagogical processes on a specific context, and the term “dynamic modeling” is understood as planning (selection) of active teaching methods allowing students to be creatively involved in the educative process.","nonlinear educational process, personal identity, formation of competencies, educational content, personification of education, Education",""

Despite the important roles that OLMs play in higher education to support the learning process and self-regulated learning (SRL) in particular, there are few studies systematically reviewing OLM technology in higher education, and investigating their potential to foster self-regulated learning. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of a 30-year sample of OLM studies in higher education and identified 64 articles that study the use of OLMs in supporting SRL. Our findings show that OLMs have been mainly used to support learners' cognition and a bit less metacognition and motivation; however, emotional support has been rarely provided. The most supported ones are Appraisal and Performance phases; Preparation of learning is enhanced by OLMs not so often. Although learners can edit or negotiate with their learning model in advanced ways, a simple inspectable OLM is more preferred. Reliance on unobservable nodes is less favored in modeling techniques in OLMs because such methods are highly dependent on expert authoring, thereby time-intensive and costly. Comparison and color-coding are two most-used features in OLMs, where the comparison feature is often used for enhancing learners’ engagement and motivation.","Open learner model, Systematic review, Self-regulated learning, Higher education",""

A limited number of studies evaluate the use of cadaver models as a potential ultrasound teaching and training modality. We hypothesize that emergency medicine residents can effectively utilize point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) on cadaver models and a focused teaching intervention to assess their ability to detect ATRs. Methods A prospective study of 23 EM residents was performed. All participants in the study were divided into two learner groups: (a) independent and (b) hands-on. The independent learner group received a 30-minute online didactic lecture demonstrating how to diagnose ATRs. The hands-on learner group received direct instruction on cadaver lower leg models with a ruptured and normal Achilles tendon (AT). Both groups then participated in identifying either normal or ruptured ATs on six cadaver lower leg models. Results The sensitivity and specificity were 89% and 82% in the independent learner group 96% and 100% in the hands-on learner group, respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 88%, respectively. There was a trend toward successful identification with increased years of residency training. Conclusions In this study, lower leg and ankle cadaver models were found to be as effective as an independent learner model for potential POCUS teaching and training modality in both novice and more advanced trainees.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.

Several researchers have developed various methods based on machine learning for better tracing students’ knowledge. Most of these methods have shown an effective estimation of student features and an accurate prediction of future performance. However, these methods recognized certain limitations since they use only the correctness of prior student responses to make predictions without paying attention to many other important student behaviors. In addition, researchers have only considered scaffolding items as a pure method of learning without having analyzed student performance at the time of answering these items. Our purpose in this article is to conduct an experiment that aims to evaluate how best to use data about the prior required scaffolding items to predict future student performance. For this reason, we proposed two separate models, namely, the first one identifies whether a student has previously required to use scaffolding items prior main question or has immediately answered it without requiring assistance. For the second model, as an improvement of model 1, our objective is to improve the student’s performance under the constraint of answering scaffolding items. The performance of our two models is evaluated against the original Performance Factors Analysis algorithm to mark differences. The results show that the two proposed models provide a positive improvement in predicting the future performance of students. Moreover, our second model can reliably increase the predictive accuracy.","Student knowledge tracing, Intelligent tutoring system, Machine learning, Scaffolding items, Prediction student performance, Performance factors analysis",""

A wide variety of KT techniques have been developed, from Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). However, in most of these methods, the KCs are represented as stand-alone entities, and the effect of representing KCs using contexts such as learning-related factors has been under-investigated. Also, KT needs to generate personalized results to facilitate tasks such as exercise recommendation. In this paper, we propose two approaches that use a contextualized representation of KCs, one with a content-based approach and another with a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network plus a personalization mechanism.

Originally, learner models remained hidden, as their primary role was to enable a system to personalize the educational interaction. Opening the model in an understandable form provides additional methods of prompting reflection, planning, and other metacognitive activities that are important in learning. Learner-system discussion, editing or other interaction about the learner model can allow users to contribute more directly to the modeling process to increase its accuracy, while at the same time, further facilitating reflection as they justify their viewpoints to themselves and the system. Social learning can be supported by opening learner models to peers, helping learners to gauge their relative progress, and effectively seek collaborators. OLMs can also provide useful information to others supporting the learning process, such as teachers and parents. OLMs are set to take an increasing role as new learning technologies develop.","Computing and Processing, General Topics for Engineers, Data models, Computational modeling, Context modeling, Navigation, Data visualization, Biological system modeling, Meters, Open learner models (OLM), overview, review.",""

Game-based learning was long used for attracting and maintaining students’ interest especially in small ages, deploying means such as scoring, timing, scores of peers (i.e., hall of fame), etc. These techniques can provide recognition for high-scoring players, while also developing a sense of safe “distance” in the impersonal electronic environment for low-scoring players. In addition, constructive feedback on mistakes a player makes can contribute to avoiding similar mistakes in the future, thus achieving better performance in the game, while constructing valuable new knowledge when a knowledge gap is detected. This paper investigates an integrated approach to designing, implementing, and using an adaptive game for assessing and gradually improving multiplication skills. Student motivation is fostered by incorporating the Open Learner Model approach, which exposes part of the underlying user model to the students in a graphically simplified manner that is easily perceivable and offers a clear picture of student performance. In addition, the Open Learner Model is expanded with visualizations of social comparison information, where students can access the progress of anonymous peers and summative class scores for improving self-reflection and fostering self-regulated learning. This paper also presents the feedback received by the preliminary testing of the game and discusses the effect of assessing multiplication skills of primary school pupils using the adaptive game-based approach on increasing pupil motivation to self-improve.","learner motivation, gamification, adaptive educational game, self-regulated learning, open social learner model, Information technology, T58.5-58.64",""

The approach defines which concepts from domain knowledge should be included in the initial test so the system can make conclusions about what students truly know about domain knowledge. This representative subset of domain knowledge is defined using non-semantic mathematical approach based on graph theory. The initial test, created over a domain knowledge representative subset, guarantees encompassing all concepts that are relevant to domain knowledge.

Although critical reading, which is the main medium for accessing the right knowledge, is defined as a sub-category for creative reading in which high cognitive processes are involved, the connection between these has not been clearly put forward. This study aimed at examining the effect of critical reading skills of 5th grade learners on their evaluation skills of creative reading process, and the role of gender in this effect through structural equation modelling. Research Methods: The study was supported by relational screening model. The study group was formed by simple random sampling and composed of 265 5th grade learners. The data were collected through the Scale for the Evaluation of Creative Reading Process and the Critical Reading Scale. SPSS 23, AMOS 22.0, and structural equation modeling were utilized for data analysis. Maximum Likelihood method was selected in the estimation of parameters related to models which were formed for examining the effect of critical reading skills on the evaluation of creative reading process and the role of gender. To this end, fit indices (X[superscript 2]/df, CFI, GFI, TLI, NFI, IFI, RMSEA, and SRMR) were used. Findings: The study demonstrated that all hypotheses models were valid; critical reading skills explained the evaluation skills of creative reading process by 57%, and that they had a direct and strong impact on the evaluation skills of the critical reading process. In the female learner model, critical reading skills affected the evaluation skills by 43%, whereas the malelearner model explained this effect by 67%. In addition, both models bear a direct and strong impact. Implications for Research and Practice: The results of the study reveal that critical reading skill is a significant predictor for the evaluation of the creative reading process. It can be stated that the evaluation skills of the creative reading process may improve in conjunction with the development of critical reading skills.","Critical Reading; Reading Processes; Grade 5; Elementary School Students; Creativity; Gender Differences; Structural Equation Models; Models; Cognitive Processes; Rating Scales; Predictor Variables",""

This proposal is complemented by the objective of determining the influence of different learning styles on the preference for the type of performance in university teaching. A hypothetico-deductive methodological design for exploratory and correlational purposes was followed. The sample consisted of total of 640 participants in university degree courses. The data were gathered using a questionnaire that grouped 46 items into five double-response dimensions, determined by the preference or position held by the students regarding the learning strategies, methods and techniques applied; material or resources used to carry out the teaching, as well as the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT); type of supports that were received in the process; instruments to carry out the assessment; and lastly, individual or team academic performance. The outcomes show an x-ray of four models according to the student's learning styles: individual, cooperative, dependent and autonomous. These are identified with four clusters in the sample of students selected for the study, which are associated with practical, conventional, critical and efficient student models. The conclusions explain that there are no pure models, as there are nuances that connect them in real classroom practice, but the level of student preference helps to measure the impact and confirms the improvement in teaching through university work projects.","Cognitive Style; College Students; Learning Strategies; Active Learning; Cooperative Learning; Models; Personal Autonomy; Teaching Methods",""

Generally, student performance prediction is achieved by tracing the evolution of each student's knowledge states via a series of learning activities. Every learning activity record has two types of feature data: student behavior and exercise features. However, most methods use features that are related to exercises, such as correctness and concepts, while other student behavior features are usually ignored. The few studies that have focused on student behavior features through subjective manual selection argue that different student behavior features can be used in an equivalent manner to predict student performance. In this paper, we assume that the integration of student behavior features and exercise features is crucial to improve the precision of prediction, and each feature has a different impact on student performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework for student performance prediction by making full use of both student behavior features and exercise features and combining the attention mechanism with the knowledge tracing model. Specifically, we first exploit machine learning to capture feature representation automatically. Then, a fusion attention mechanism based on recurrent neural network architecture is used for student performance prediction. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness and practicability of our approach. The accuracy of our method is up to 98%, which is superior to previous methods.","Student performance prediction, knowledge tracing, recurrent neural network, attention mechanism, Electrical engineering.

However, the complexity of the tasks may impede the progress of novice learners. Providing adaptive feedback to learners who face difficulties requires learner modeling approaches that can identify learners' proficiencies and the difficulties they face in executing required skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes. This paper discusses a multilevel hierarchical learner modeling scheme that analyzes and captures learners' cognitive processes and problem-solving strategies along with their performance on assigned tasks in a game-based environment called UrbanSim that requires complex decision making for dealing with counterinsurgency scenarios. As the scenario evolves in a turn-by-turn fashion, UrbanSim evaluates the learners' moves using a number of performance measures. Our learner modeling scheme interprets the reported performance values by analyzing the learners' activities captured in log files to derive learners' proficiencies in associated cognitive skills and strategies, and updates the learner model. We discuss the details of the learner modeling algorithms in this paper, and then demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting results from a study we conducted at Vanderbilt University.","Computing and Processing, General Topics for Engineers, Task analysis, Problem-solving, Decision making, Sociology, Statistics, Games, Economics, Complex decision making, multilevel learner modeling, cognitive strategies, learning analytics, UrbanSim",""

Given a learner's history of past interactions with an ITS, a learner performance model estimates the current state of a learner's knowledge and predicts her future performance. The advent of increasingly large scale datasets has turned deep learning models for learner performance prediction into competitive alternatives to classical Markov process and logistic regression models. In an extensive empirical comparison on nine real-world datasets, we ask which approach makes the most accurate predictions and in what conditions. Logistic regression--with the right set of features--leads on datasets of moderate size or containing or containing a very large number of interactions per student, whereas Deep Knowledge Tracing leads on datasets of large size or where precise temporal information matters most. Markov process methods, like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, lag behind other approaches. We follow this analysis with ablation studies to determine what components of leading algorithms explain their performance and a discussion of model calibration (reliability), which is crucial for downstream applications of learner performance prediction models.","Learning Processes; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Feedback (Response); Knowledge Level; Prediction; Markov Processes; Comparative Analysis; Data Analysis; Bayesian Statistics; Academic Achievement",""

The approach defines which concepts from domain knowledge should be included in the initial test so the system can make conclusions about what students truly know about domain knowledge. This representative subset of domain knowledge is defined using non-semantic mathematical approach based on graph theory. The initial test, created over a domain knowledge representative subset, guarantees encompassing all concepts that are relevant to domain knowledge. A two-level case study is conducted on what would be the representative subset of one selected domain knowledge. It compares semantically selected domain knowledge representative subsets (semantical analysis was done by domain area experts) to a non-semantical, mathematically selected domain knowledge representative subset. The results of the case study show that problems of inequality of semantically selected domain knowledge representative subsets are easily overcome using the presented approach.

Thus, for problems where we have few amounts of data for training, the generalization power will be low, the models will tend to give good results on classes containing many examples and poor results on those with few examples. Theses problems are frequent in educational data where for example, there are skills that are very difficult (floor) or very easy to master (ceiling). There will be less data on students that correctly answered questions related to difficult knowledge and that incorrectly answered questions related to knowledge easy to master. In that case, the DKT is unable to correctly predict the student's answers to questions associated with those skills. To improve the DKT, we penalize the model using a 'cost-sensitive' technique. To overcome the problem of the few amounts of data, we propose a hybrid model combining the DKT and expert knowledge. Thus, the DKT is combined with a Bayesian Network (built from domain experts) by using the attention mechanism. The resulting model can accurately track knowledge of students in Logic-Muse Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), compared to the BKT and the original DKT.","",""

Then the target domain adaptively learns from the source domain. Specifically, there is a balance between the learning by the target domain itself and the instruction from the source domain. That is, when the guidance from the source domain is helpful for learning, the learning of target classifier emphasizes the instruction of source knowledge, and considers its own knowledge more, otherwise.

The Web offers several platforms for distance learning, calibrated for the public or private sector. Among these, the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are one of the most popular online learning assets. In MOOCs, a crucial feature is given by the amount of enrolled learners: thousands can attend such courses. Consequently, monitoring the learning process of individual students is a challenging task for teachers in MOOCs. Peer Assessment can be used, in these case, as a teaching strategy, to follow the dynamics of a MOOC while not checking directly on each one of the individual students.

Improvements on earlier models have shown that separate predictors for prior successes, failures, and recent performance further improve fit while remaining interpretable. However, students who engage in ""gaming"" or other off-task behaviors may reduce the predictiveness of learner models that treat counts of prior performance equivalently across gaming and non-gaming student populations. The present research evaluated how sub-groups of students that varied in their potential gaming behavior were differently fit by a logistic learner model, and whether any observed differences between sub-groups could inspire the creation of new predictors that might improve model fit. Student data extracted from a college-level online learning application were clustered according to speed and accuracy using Gaussian mixture modeling. Distinct clusters were found, with similar cluster patterns detected in three separate datasets. Subsequently, each cluster was separately fit to a Performance Factors Analysis model (PFA). Significantly different parameter coefficients across clusters implied that students more likely to have been gaming benefitted less from prior failures. These differences inspired new and modified predictors that were found to improve overall model fit -- an improvement that varied in magnitude across clusters.

Data were transcribed, verbatim, and manually coded and analysed by the researcher using the applied research methodology of framework analysis, enabling the investigation of the a priori theme 'practice placement model', and recommendations were made for improvement.; Results: Two radiotherapy placement models are confirmed, i.e. the single student model, and the paired student model, and advantages and disadvantages are identified for each. Study findings suggest that neither radiotherapy model is superior to the other in terms of placement education and experience. Previous and current experience of either model appears to bias students and practice educators towards that model, despite recognition of its disadvantages.; Conclusion: The experiences of students and practice educators using the radiotherapy models are consistent with the experiences of other AHPs and nursing using similar practice placement models. It is recommended that all students should have access to peer-assisted learning on placement to improve critical thinking skills, to enable time for reflection, and to consolidate learning.

Knowledge estimation is frequently used to make decisions about when a student has reached mastery and is ready to advance to new material, but there has been little work to forecast how far a student is from mastery or predict how much more practice the student will need before he or she will reach mastery. This article presents a method for predicting the point at which a student will reach skill mastery within an adaptive learning system, based on current approaches to estimating student knowledge. We apply this technique to two popular methods of modeling student learning – Bayesian knowledge tracing and performance factors analysis – and compare prediction correctness. Potential applications and future steps for improving the method are discussed.

This is based on the student's learning history on the ASSISTments blended learning platform in the form of extensive clickstream data gathered during the middle school years. To tackle this challenge, we first estimate the expected knowledge state of students with respect to different mathematical skills using a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model and an enhanced DKT (DKT+) model. We then combine the features corresponding to the DKT/DKT+ expected knowledge state with other features extracted directly from the student profile in the dataset to train several machine learning models for the STEM/non-STEM job prediction. Our experiments show that models trained with the combined features generally perform better than the models trained with the student profile alone. Detailed analysis on the student's knowledge state reveals that, when compared with non-STEM students, STEM students generally show a higher mastery level and a higher learning gain in mathematics.

Recently there has been increased attention on learning explanatory models as a key to conceptual understanding. Science educators also struggle with how to teach students scientific thinking practices, and sometimes this goal is seen as being in competition with content goals for conceptual understanding. In this study we ask whether whole class discussion can contribute to both of these goals at the same time and whether there are ways that a teacher can support this. We describe the results of a case study of an experienced teacher leading modeling discussions in a series of three middle school life sciences classes. A qualitative microanalysis of the videotaped whole class discussions led to the identification of a variety of modeling processes operating across the lessons at two different time scale levels. These include model competition, in which students compare and evaluate their models, and model evolution, in which the models go through stepwise evaluation and improvement. The latter process involves a smaller time scale pattern of model generation, evaluation, and modification cycles. All of these processes are similar to those found in recent studies of practices of expert scientists. Implications from the case study suggest that: (1) A teacher need not be limited to the two opposing interaction styles of Open Discussion vs. Authoritative lecture. Rather, there are there intermediate discussion styles between these that involve co-construction and cognitive scaffolding; (2) It is possible to start from student-generated models that conflict with the target model in a number of ways, and still arrive at the target model for the lesson through discussion. Processes of model competition and disconfirmation, as well as model evolution, both supported by the teacher's cognitive scaffolding, were central in this accomplishment; (3) In doing so, it is possible for a teacher to foster student modeling practices, as a type of scientific thinking, at the same time that they are teaching science content, by scaffolding the two levels of model construction processes identified.","science learning, science teaching, classroom discussion, scaffolding, scientific thinking, scientific practices, Education (General), L7-991",""

Students were provided with three pieces of evidence related to this phenomenon and asked to construct a model to account for this evidence. Findings indicate that domain-specific resources play a significant role in the extent to which the models accounted for provided evidence.

Research has shown that adaptive e-learning improves the effectiveness of e-learning systems and removes the loneliness experienced by learners when they are online. Though this is the case, adaptive e-learning systems face the challenge of not only utilizing one learner characteristic to provide adaptation but also the problem of deciding which learner characteristic to model. This study was carried out in order to develop a learner model based on learning theories since learning theories do spell out on how learning occurs and therefore useful in determining which learner characteristic to model. Systematic literature review on articles dealing with adaptive e-learning was carried out. Articles were extracted from various databases and were selected using a three step process. 16 articles were selected for the final analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that, there is evidence of basing adaptive e-learning systems on learning theories and the most utilized theory is cognitivism.

Recently large scale efforts have been devoted toward assessing CPS skills, but there are no agreed upon guiding principles for assessment of this complex construct, particularly for assessment in digital performance situations. There are notable challenges in conceptualizing the complex construct and extracting evidence of CPS skills from large streams of data in digital contexts such as games and simulations. In the current paper, we discuss how the in-task assessment framework (I-TAF), a framework informed by evidence-centered design, can provide guiding principles for the assessment of CPS in these contexts. We give specific attention to one aspect of I-TAF, ontologies, and describe how they can be used to instantiate the student model in evidence-centered design which lays out what we wish to measure in a principled way. We further discuss how ontologies can serve as an anchor representation for other components of assessment such as scoring rubrics, evidence identification, and task design.

An adaptive learning environment model can be subdivided into a learner model, domain model, instructional model and adaptive engine. Personal traits comprise part of the components in a learner model and can be identified either explicitly or implicitly in an adaptive learning environment. In such an environment, the e-learning system should adapt to a learner's needs. However, even though academic research on adaptive learning environments has increased, the field lacks a comprehensive literature analysis of learners' personal traits in these environments. This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify the most commonly used personal traits in modelling the learner and the existing techniques suitable for identifying personal traits in an adaptive learning environment. A total of 140 articles spanning the years 2010–2017 are initially reviewed, from which 78 are selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria relevant to this study. This study provides an overview of learners' personal traits and the techniques used to identify them to provide a basis for improving adaptive learning environments. The findings indicate that most of the previous works used a learning style from the cognition learning domain category to model individual personal traits, while the computer-based detection technique was commonly applied to identify a learner's personal traits in adaptive learning environments. This study reveals the common learner characteristics used to develop learner models and the techniques for implementing such models. The findings of this paper can guide other researchers to recognise various personal traits and the identification technique for further studies, as well as assist developers in the development of the adaptive learning system.","Cooperative/collaborative learning, Intelligent tutoring systems, Interactive learning environments, Navigation",""

Indeed, the personalization of the learning process for every user is needed to increase the student satisfaction and learning efficiency. Nevertheless, the number of students who give up their learning process cannot be neglected. Therefore, it is mandatory to establish an efficient way to assess the level of personalization in such systems. In fact, assessing represents the evolution's key in every personalized application and especially for the e-learning systems. Besides, when the e-learning system can decipher the student personality, the student learning process will be stabilized, and the dropout rate will be decreased. In this context, we propose to evaluate the personalization process in an e-learning platform using an intelligent referential system based on agents. It evaluates any recommendation made by the e-learning platform based on a comparison. We compare the personalized service of the e-learning system and those provided by our referential system. Therefore, our purpose consists in increasing the efficiency of the proposed system to obtain a significant assessment result; precisely, the aim is to improve the outcomes of every algorithm used in each defined agent. This paper deals with the intelligent agent 'Mod-Knowledge' responsible for analyzing the student interaction to trace the student knowledge state. The originality of this agent is that it treats the external and the internal student interactions using machine learning algorithms to obtain a complete view of the student knowledge state. The validation of this contribution is done with experiments showing that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing ones.

Studies on student clustering are abundant; however, a system for clustering metacognitive that considers proper analysis technique of Likert-scaled dataset is unavailable. This article proposes a student clustering method which uses a new Likert scale analysis. It is performed on a dataset collected from 81 students of a vocational high school. The performance was compared to previous methods; enhancement is shown by higher silhouette-index and strong correlation with work readiness score. To evaluate the clustering effectiveness, it is implemented on an e-learning system to generate adaptive instructions. The e-learning system is a supplement for fundamental programming course in the school. The t-test result shows that learning gain of experiment group is significantly higher that of the control group. Therefore, the proposed method is effective in improving students' learning quality.","Computer programming, Vocational education -- Methods, Computer programming -- Study and teaching, Education -- Methods, Education -- Analysis, Education",""

In addition to dedicated methods of didactics of statistics, adaptive educational technologies can also offer a promising approach to target this challenge. Inspectable student models provide students with information about their mastery of the domain, thus triggering reflection and supporting the planning of subsequent study steps. In this article, we investigate the question of whether insights from didactics of statistics can be combined with inspectable student models and examine if the two can reinforce each other. Five inspectable student models were implemented within five didactically grounded online statistics modules, which were offered to 160 Social Sciences students as part of their first-year university statistics course. The student models were evaluated using several methods. Learning curve analysis and predictive validity analysis examined the quality of the student models from the technical point of view, while a questionnaire and a task analysis provided a didactical perspective. The results suggest that students appreciated the overall design, but the learning curve analysis revealed several weaknesses in the implemented domain structure. The task analysis revealed four underlying problems that help to explain these weaknesses. Addressing these problems improved both the predictive validity of the adjusted student models and the quality of the instructional modules themselves. These results provide insight into how inspectable student models and didactics of statistics can augment each other in the design of rich instructional modules for statistics.","Inspectable student model, Open student model, Statistics education, Higher education, Learning curve analysis",""

Such assessments could ideally be useful in multiple phases of the instructional process by providing information to learners, teachers, and other stakeholders because the technologies allow for efficiencies of task presentation, response gathering, scoring, storing data, and returning results. With the goal of understanding the development costs required to achieve such benefits, the project used an evidence-centered design (ECD) framework to create a prototype assessment for ELL middle school students. In addition to describing the ECD process, the report describes how the project mandate helped to focus the complex processes of ECD and how the activities of ECD came into play in sketching plans for the validity argument. The ECD process of domain analysis uncovered perspectives on tablet use in middle schools as well as theoretical perspectives for conceptualizing the tablet users' abilities and learning. Findings included a range of uses of mobile technologies in middle school classrooms in 2013, with little uniformity in practices. Based on analysis of common elements in tablet-based communication and learning, a framework for characterizing the relevant strategies and abilities was developed. Findings served in the domain modeling process of defining task design patterns, which in turn provided the basis for planning the conceptual assessment framework (CAF). The CAF also drew upon domain analysis findings, which suggested the concepts required for defining a student model (what is to be inferred about the test taker), an evidence model (the basis for making the inference), and the task model (the features of tasks required for eliciting relevant performance). The assessment implementation process produced a working prototype that served in usability testing and gathering feedback from middle school teachers. The report describes how ECD guides the design of tablet-based formative assessment tasks that take into account the constructs to be measured and the learning that should result from test taking. The evaluation of the project is undertaken in view of the goal of ECD to design test tasks in a manner that serves in the argument for their use. Success is therefore evaluated in part by an analysis of the quality of content it supplied for an interpretation/use argument for the assessment. Overall, the project highlights include (a) the demonstration of how a mandate delimits the ECD processes; (b) the construct framework encompassing both the linguistic and nonlinguistic resources used to create meaning in a digital environment; (c) the approach used for analysis of a domain with emerging, shifting, and variously used technologies; and (d) the use of an interpretation/use argument in the appraisal of an ECD test design.","Middle School Students; English Language Learners; Language Proficiency; Test Construction; Handheld Devices; Telecommunications; Technology Uses in Education; Evidence Based Practice; Computer Oriented Programs; Design, Iowa",""

In order to address this issue, we advocate for and propose to incorporate the knowledge structure information, especially the prerequisite relations between pedagogical concepts, into the knowledge tracing model. Specifically, by considering how students master pedagogical concepts and their prerequisites, we model prerequisite concept pairs as ordering pairs. With a proper mathematical formulation, this property can be utilized as constraints in designing knowledge tracing model. As a result, the obtained model can have a better performance on student concept mastery prediction.

We call this model dAFM, based on augmentation of the original Additive Factors Model (AFM), whose calculations and constraints we show can be exactly replicated within the framework of neural networks. In order to parameterize the Q-matrix definition in the model, the associations between questions and knowledge components (KC) need to be represented by adjustable weights. Furthermore, student KC opportunity counts, instead of serving as fixed inputs, need to be calculated dynamically as the Q-matrix changes during training. We describe our solutions to these two modeling challenges and evaluate several variants of our fully realized model on datasets from the Cognitive Tutor and ASSISTments. We compare learning the Q-matrix from scratch vs. refining an expert specified KC model and evaluate various procedures for refinement. In our quantitative predictive analysis, we find that dAFM learns a better generalizing Q-matrix than the original expert model in all our primary datasets. Using a development set, we also find that the dAFM Q-matrix is superior to KC representations extracted from trained Deep Knowledge Tracing and skip-gram models. Examples are shown of questions whose fit was improved by dAFM with depictions of their original and refined KC associations. We consistently find in our experiments that our dAFM variant which attempted to learn the Q-matrix from scratch underperformed models which started with an expert defined Q-matrix that was then refined. This observation continues a theme in EDM of utility found in the enduring value of expert domain knowledge enhanced through data-driven refinement.","Q Methodology; Psychometrics; Models; Knowledge Level; Artificial Intelligence; Tests; Measurement; Data Collection; Data Analysis",""

In this work, we directly compared three models: BKT, its variant Intervention-BKT (IBKT), and LSTM, on two types of student modeling tasks: post-test scores prediction and learning gains prediction. Additionally, while previous work on student learning has often used skill/knowledge components identified by domain experts, we incorporated an automatic skill discovery method (SK), which includes a nonparametric prior over the exercise-skill assignments, to all three models. Thus, we explored a total of six models: BKT, BKT+SK, IBKT, IBKT+SK, LSTM, and LSTM+SK. Two training datasets were employed, one was collected from a natural language physics intelligent tutoring system named Cordillera, and the other was from a standard probability intelligent tutoring system named Pyrenees. Overall, our results showed that BKT and BKT+SK outperformed the others on predicting post-test scores, whereas LSTM and LSTM+SK achieved the highest accuracy, F1-measure, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) on predicting learning gains. Furthermore, we demonstrated that by combining SK with the BKT model, BKT+SK could reliably predict post-test scores using only the earliest 50% of the entire training sequences.

The results show that the choice of data sources used for mastery decision and the setting of thresholds are more important than the choice of a learner modelling technique. We argue that a simple exponential moving average method is a suitable technique for mastery criterion and discuss techniques for the choice of a mastery threshold. We also propose an extension of the exponential moving average method that takes into account practical aspects like time intensity of items and we report on a practical application of this mastery criterion in a widely used educational system.

Currently, an e-learning system which is complemented by metacognitive scaffolding has been developed. The scaffolding includes a recommendation system given by a virtual pedagogical agent.

Two types of recommendations are aimed, including recommendation for the definition of learning goal/sub-goal and learning strategy. Goal/sub-goal recommendation is generated by identifying students' level of prior knowledge by using text classification algorithm. On the other hand, the strategy-use recommendation is generated by modeling the fitness of previously used learning strategy using fuzzy inference system and analyzing students' interaction log with the learning strategy. Implementation of the proposed scheme produces a prototype of the recommendation system. An A/B testing is conducted to compare previous and newer recommendation systems.

However, existing work doesn't provide enough analysis tools to analyze how students performed, which factors would affect their performance, in which way students can make progress, and whether students have potential to perform better. To solve those problems, we have provided multiple analysis tools to analyze student performance, student progress and student potentials in different ways. First, this paper formulates student model with performance related attributes and non-performance related attributes by Student Attribute Matrix (SAM), which quantifies student attributes, so that we can use it to make further analysis. Second, this paper provides a student performance estimation tools using Back Propagation Neural Network (BP-NN) based on classification, which can estimate student performance/attributes according to students' prior knowledge as well as the performance/attributes of other students who have similar characteristics. Third, this paper proposes student progress indicators and attribute causal relationship predicator based on BP-NN to comprehensively describe student progress on various aspects together with their causal relationships. Those indicators and predicator can tell how much a factor would affect student performance, so that we can train up students on purpose. Finally, this paper proposes a student potential function that evaluates student achievement and development of such attributes. We have illustrated our analysis tools by using real academic performance data collected from 60 high school students. Evaluation results show that the proposed tools can give correct and more accurate results, and also offer a better understanding on student progress.","Evaluation methodologies, Intelligent tutoring systems, Teaching/learning strategies, Applications in subject areas, Simulations",""

In the scientific literature, it seems to be of particular interest to provide educational applications and systems with “intelligence”, in order to be able to adapt either the learning material or the tutoring and learning processes to each individual student's needs. The module of student model is crucial for offering a personalized learning experience to each particular student. Student modeling has been introduced in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), but it's use has been extended to most current educational software applications that aim to be adaptive and personalized. Student modeling is able to highlight students individual needs, learning characteristics, knowledge level, errors or misconceptions etc. However, building a student model is a complex process. In this paper, a novel web service API, which creates platform-independent and technological-independent student models using the technology of web services, is presented. The presented API is called FSP Creator. Its innovative operation relies on the facts that the created student profile i) can be embedded in any educational application (web, mobile, game), regardless of the system's technological characteristics or programming language, ii) can be recognized by all the different applications that use it and call the same web services. Furthermore, the created student profile is based on fuzzy logic sets that are used by a Fuzzy Rule System incorporated in FSP Creator and used for selecting the appropriate learning material and exercises. However, each application that uses the created student profile can extend the fuzzy rule set or use its own fuzzy rule set as desired. For the description of the operations of FSP Creator, we have used three different educational applications (two games and one web-based educational application) that have used the fuzzy student profile, which has been created by the presented API.","",""

Sixty undergraduate students received expository instruction about natural selection, which presented the canonical, scientifically accepted account in detail. Two-third of these received CEC&C feedback on their self-generated solutions to open-ended test items. Students either received this feedback on their pretest solutions (prior to instruction), or on their immediate posttest solutions (following instruction). Students in the control condition only received the correct canonical answers to the immediate post-test items and compared these with their own solutions autonomously. Conceptual understanding on transfer items was assessed after 1 week. Results showed that students in the CEC&C feedback conditions outperformed control students.

This competitive initiative sponsored four teams that separately developed systems that covered topics in mathematics, electronics, and dynamical systems. After the teams shared their progress at the conclusion of an 18-month period, the ONR decided to fund a joint applied project in the Navy that integrated those systems on the subject matter of electronic circuits. The University of Memphis took the lead in integrating these systems in an intelligent tutoring system called ElectronixTutor. This article describes the architecture of ElectronixTutor, the learning resources that feed into it, and the empirical findings that support the effectiveness of its constituent ITS learning resources.Results: A fully integrated ElectronixTutor was developed that included several intelligent learning resources (AutoTutor, Dragoon, LearnForm, ASSISTments, BEETLE-II) as well as texts and videos. The architecture includes a student model that has (a) a common set of knowledge components on electronic circuits to which individual learning resources contribute and (b) a record of student performance on the knowledge components as well as a set of cognitive and non-cognitive attributes. There is a recommender system that uses the student model to guide the student on a small set of sensible next steps in their training. The individual components of ElectronixTutor have shown learning gains in previous decades of research.Conclusions: The ElectronixTutor system successfully combines multiple empirically based components into one system to teach a STEM topic (electronics) to students. A prototype of this intelligent tutoring system has been developed and is currently being tested. ElectronixTutor is unique in its assembling a group of well-tested intelligent tutoring systems into a single integrated learning environment.","ASSISTments, AutoTutor, Dragoon, Electronics, Intelligent tutoring systems, System integration",""

The main issue in lifelong learner model design is what type of information needs to be stored in the learner model and how the information granularity is involved. The type and level of information granularity of a user will determine how appropriate the pedagogical policies are to be provided by the system for a user. Lifelong learner model design should be in line with the principles of lifelong learning, namely sociality, interoperability, and scrutability. This paper discusses our research on learner model ontology for lifelong learning. The goal expected to be achieved is that there is a lifelong learner model ontology to be accessed and updated by adaptive learning systems. This research classifies learners' attributes into two groups, which are static and dynamic attributes. Static attributes tend not to change or very rarely change. They include learner's profile, special needs, aptitude, preference, learning approach, learning style, personality, and cognitive capability. On the other hand, dynamic attributes include learning history and study plan. Through conducting some experiments, it can be concluded that LifeOn supports ubiquitous and lifelong learning, and can be used in adaptive learning systems with various learner models.","",""

(2) With our student model, inference can be conducted analytically rather than numerically, thus allowing computationally efficient planning to optimize learning. (3) We develop a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical control technique that allows the teaching policy to search through deeper learning trajectories. We demonstrate our approach in a novel ITS for foreign language learning similar to Rosetta Stone and show that the automatically generated AOTAOL teaching policy performs favorably compared to two hand-crafted teaching policies.","Computing and Processing, Education, Computational modeling, Numerical models, Optimal control, Analytical models, Stochastic processes, Vocabulary, Intelligent tutoring systems, stochastic optimal control, partially observable Markov decision processes",""

This competitive initiative sponsored four teams that separately developed systems that covered topics in mathematics, electronics, and dynamical systems. After the teams shared their progress at the conclusion of an 18-month period, the ONR decided to fund a joint applied project in the Navy that integrated those systems on the subject matter of electronic circuits. The University of Memphis took the lead in integrating these systems in an intelligent tutoring system called ElectronixTutor. This article describes the architecture of ElectronixTutor, the learning resources that feed into it, and the empirical findings that support the effectiveness of its constituent ITS learning resources. Results A fully integrated ElectronixTutor was developed that included several intelligent learning resources (AutoTutor, Dragoon, LearnForm, ASSISTments, BEETLE-II) as well as texts and videos. The architecture includes a student model that has (a) a common set of knowledge components on electronic circuits to which individual learning resources contribute and (b) a record of student performance on the knowledge components as well as a set of cognitive and non-cognitive attributes. There is a recommender system that uses the student model to guide the student on a small set of sensible next steps in their training. The individual components of ElectronixTutor have shown learning gains in previous decades of research. Conclusions The ElectronixTutor system successfully combines multiple empirically based components into one system to teach a STEM topic (electronics) to students. A prototype of this intelligent tutoring system has been developed and is currently being tested. ElectronixTutor is unique in its assembling a group of well-tested intelligent tutoring systems into a single integrated learning environment.","ASSISTments, AutoTutor, Dragoon, Electronics, Intelligent tutoring systems, System integration, Education, Education (General), L7-991, Special aspects of education, LC8-6691, Theory and practice of education, LB5-3640",""

Such algorithms have proven to be quite effective in big-data learning settings (massive open online courses), yet successful applications in other informal and formal learning settings are rare. Common challenges include data sparsity, the lack of sufficiently flexible learner and domain models, and the difficulty of including pedagogical goals into recommendation strategies. Computational models of human cognition and learning are, in principle, well positioned to help meet these challenges, yet the effectiveness of cognitive models in educational recommender systems remains poorly understood to this date. This thesis contributes to this strand of research by investigating i) two cognitive learner models (CbKST and SUSTAIN) for resource recommendations that qualify for sparse user data by following theory-driven top down approaches, and ii) two tag recommendation strategies based on models of human cognition (BLL and MINERVA2) that support the creation of learning content meta-data. The results of four online and offline experiments in different learning contexts indicate that a recommendation approach based on the CbKST, a well-founded structural model of knowledge representation, can improve the users? perceived learning experience in formal learning settings. In informal settings, SUSTAIN, a human category learning model, is shown to succeed in representing dynamic, interest based learning interactions and to improve Collaborative Filtering for resource recommendations. The investigation of the two proposed tag recommender strategies underlined their ability to generate accurate suggestions (BLL) and in collaborative settings, their potential to promote the development of shared vocabulary (MINERVA2). This thesis shows that the application of computational models of human cognition holds promise for the design of recommender mechanisms and, at the same time, for gaining a deeper understanding of interaction dynamics in virtual learning systems.","",""

Two main issues exist in the current DKT models: First, the complexity of the DKT models increases the tension of psychological interpretation. Second, the input of existing DKT models is only the exercise tags representing via one-hot encoding. The correlation between the hidden knowledge components and students’ responses to the exercises heavily relies on training the DKT models. The existing rich and informative features are excluded in the training, which may yield sub-optimal performance. To utilize the information embedded in these features, researchers have proposed a manual method to pre-process the features, i.e., discretizing them based on the inner characteristics of individual features. However, the proposed method requires many feature engineering efforts and is infeasible when the selected features are huge. To tackle the above issues, we design an automatic system to embed the heterogeneous features implicitly and effectively into the original DKT model. More specifically, we apply tree-based classifiers to predict whether the student can correctly answer the exercise given the heterogeneous features, an effective way to capture how the student deviates from others in the exercise. The predicted response and the true response are then encoded into a 4-bit one-hot encoding and concatenated with the original one-hot encoding features on the exercise tags to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which can output the probability that a student will answer the exercise correctly on the corresponding exercise. We conduct a thorough evaluation on two educational datasets and demonstrate the merits and observations of our proposal.","Recurrent neural networks, Knowledge tracing, Tree-based classifiers",""

A recently deceased, un-embalmed donor was scanned through high-resolution computed tomography. The scan data underwent segmentation and post-processing and a range of 3D-printed anatomical models were produced. A four-stage mixed-methods study was conducted to evaluate the educational value of the models in a medical program. (1) A quantitative pre/post-test to assess change in learner knowledge following 3D-printed model usage in a small group tutorial; (2) student focus group (3) a qualitative student questionnaire regarding personal student model usage (4) teaching faculty evaluation. The use of 3D-printed models in small-group anatomy teaching session resulted in a significant increase in knowledge (P = 0.0001) when compared to didactic 2D-image based teaching methods. Student focus groups yielded six key themes regarding the use of 3D-printed anatomical models: model properties, teaching integration, resource integration, assessment, clinical imaging, and pathology and anatomical variation. Questionnaires detailed how students used the models in the home environment and integrated them with anatomical learning resources such as textbooks and anatomy lectures. In conclusion, 3D-printed anatomical models can be successfully produced from the CT data set of a recently deceased donor. These models can be used in anatomy education as a teaching tool in their own right, as well as a method for augmenting the curriculum and complementing established learning modalities, such as dissection-based teaching.

This paper proposes an environment of e-learning based on new semantic technologies able to manage the process of building personalized educational content for training university hospital managers. The necessity of development of such a system results from the competence requirements for the specialists of human resources management (HRM) in the medical system. These goals are achieved using ontologies in implementing the personalized process of learning and in modelling the learning flow. Ontologies are used to model student profile, educational domain and learning process. These models are implemented into an intelligent learning Web platform. This ontology-based platform offers the specific tools to implement a new mechanism to obtain the relevant information from Internet. The implementation of personalization in the e-learning system is achieved starting from the student model to determine the knowledge level and to identify their preferences and interests. The students receive the learning material according to their profile, learning style, initial knowledge and education needs. Learning style and student's profile are the most important parameters in determining individual differences and define the adaptive learning environments.

Generally, there are five parameters in KT model we need to estimate, they are transition parameters: learning and forgetting probability, emission parameters: guessing and slipping probability, and prior probability. KT model is widely used in students learning outcome modeling. However, it does not support multiple subskills modeling, for the model works by checking the historical observations at a specific skill. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes three models using logistic regression over each step: KTLR-GS, extending guessing and slipping parameters; KTLR-LFID, introducing item difficult into the KT model while extending learning and forgetting parameters; KTLR-FP, extending both transition and emission parameters. Unlike previous methods our models discuss the efficiency of extending transition and emission parameters while relaxing the assumptions that subskills are independent. In the end we evaluate how well our models perform with comparison to LR-DBN, KT-IDEM and KT on two datasets: the open dataset ASSISTments, and one private dataset, student algebra dataset collected through our tutoring system.

Most LTSs rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for analyzing the student's answer to support him/her with appropriate feedback. In such systems, diagnosing the student errors is typically based on a large library of students' expected bugs. In addition, such systems (especially in case of the Arabic language) don't consider modeling of the student knowledge or assigning difficulty levels to the presented questions. Subsequently, such systems do not support individualization of their interactions to each student's needs and preferences. This paper presents the Arabic Grammar Tutor (AGTutor), which utilizes Constraint-Based Modeling (CBM) to model the domain eliminating the need for the bugs' library. Grammar rules are represented as a set of constraints that are categorized in terms of the different linguistic skills. Linguistic skills are classified into several levels and categories. Such hierarchical structure allows diagnosing the student errors in a more efficient way. In addition, modeling the student competence in the Arabic linguistic skills is also expressed in terms of a set of domain constraints. Assigning difficulty levels to each question according to the required skills and modeling the student knowledge allow the system to adapt its interactions according to the student week points to enhance his/her Arabic linguistic skills. Evaluation results have shown the effectiveness of AGTutor in tutoring the students and the satisfaction of both the students and the teachers with its features and capabilities.","",""

The freedom given to learners in this exploration context leads to a variety of learner approaches for constructing models and makes modelling of learner behavior a challenging task. To address this issue, we propose a learner modelling mechanism for monitoring learners’ actions when constructing/exploring models by modelling sequences of actions reflecting different strategies in solving a task. This is based on a modified version of case-based reasoning for problems with multiple solutions. In our formulation, approaches to explore the task are represented as sequences of simple cases linked by temporal and dependency relations, which are mapped to the learners’ behavior in the system by means of appropriate similarity metrics. This paper presents the development and validation of the modelling mechanism. The model was validated in the context of an ELE for mathematical generalisation using data from classroom sessions and pedagogically-driven learning scenarios.","Computing and Processing, Adaptation models, Mathematical model, Data models, Integrated circuit modeling, Context modeling, Analytical models, Intelligent/adaptive learning systems, learner modelling, case-based reasoning, mathematics, evaluation",""

The structure of BKT models, however, makes it impossible to represent the hierarchy and relationships between the different skills of a learning domain. Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) on the other hand are able to represent multiple skills jointly within one model. In this work, we suggest the use of DBNs for student modeling. We introduce a constrained optimization algorithm for parameter learning of such models. We extensively evaluate and interpret the prediction accuracy of our approach on five large-scale data sets of different learning domains such as mathematics, spelling learning, and physics. We furthermore provide comparisons to previous student modeling approaches and analyze the influence of the different student modeling techniques on instructional policies. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous techniques in prediction accuracy on unseen data across all learning domains and yields meaningful instructional policies.","Computing and Processing, Predictive models, Adaptation models, Mathematical model, Hidden Markov models, Bayes methods, Optimization, Indexes, Bayesian networks, parameter learning, constrained optimization, error measures, instructional policies",""

In this paper, a student model to infer the presence of ADHD symptoms in a Computer-Based Educational System (also known as Learning Management Systems (LMS)) is presented. The student model takes into account two types of students' characteristics: generic and psychological. Each one is measured through a set of variables, which are correlated to obtain a final profile that can be useful to assist the teaching-learning process.

However, there are only few educational adventure games that encompass adaptive features or their adaptivity is very limited. This paper describes an educational adventure game for learning computer programming. A student modelling component based on fuzzy logic is used to create a profile for every student and provide individualized help. The game incorporates many adaptive characteristics such as providing help through agents whenever needed. However, it's main feature is the ability to extend the scenario depending on the player's weaknesses. In this way, the game aims to motivate and engage the student by providing new screens and riddles and lengthening the total necessary time to finish it.

Abundant of studies have documented the design and implementation of the eSchoolbag. However, the relationship between students’ learning achievement and their motivational factors is still unclear when using eSchoolbag to learn English. Thus, this study examined the effect of students’ academic motivation on their English learning achievement in the eSchoolbag-based learning environment. A total of 78 participants were involved in the study, and their English learning achievement were assessed six times during 1 year. Moreover, 63 students finished the academic motivation questionnaire, and they were clustered into two groups using K-means clustering algorithm. The two groups were labelled as the high and low motivation group respectively. The research found that the eSchoolbag-based learning environment had a significantly positive effect on students’ learning achievement. Besides, students’ academic motivation also had the ability to differentiate their learning achievement when using eSchoolbag to learn English. Furthermore, this research found that students’ prior levels of learning achievement had no significant association with their academic motivation. There was also no significant association between student’s gender and his/her academic motivation. In terms of components of academic motivation, students’ attainment value of using eSchoolbag to learn English was correlated positively with their learning achievement.","eSchoolbag, Academic motivation, Learning achievement, English learning, Special aspects of education, LC8-6691",""

The first goal is to investigate the basic claims of the proposed Two-System Framework for Game-Based Learning (or 2SM) (Martinez-Garza & Clark, 2016) that may serve as part of a general-use explanatory framework for educational gaming. The second goal is to explore and demonstrate the use of automatically collected log files of student play as evidence through educational data mining techniques. These techniques could also find general use, and this paper offers a demonstration of plausible methods and processes that are suited for game play data. These goals were pursued via two research questions. The first research question examines whether students playing The Fuzzy Chronicles showed evidence of dichotomous fast/slow modes of solution. The 2SM theorizes that slow modes of solution will correlate to higher learning gains. Congruent with the 2SM, students who use mainly fast iterative solution strategies achieved lower learning gains than students who preferred slow, elaborate solutions, or a more balanced mix of the two. A second research question investigates the connection between conceptual understanding and student performance in conceptually-laden challenges. The finding was that students generally improve their performance in these challenges as gameplay progresses, but that this improvement is strongly moderated by their prior knowledge of physics. Implications of these findings in terms of educational game design, analysis of gameplay logs, and further refinement of the 2SM are discussed.","Data Mining, Games for Learning, Science Education, Student Modelling",""

However, similarly to other Exploratory Learning Environments, students may not always learn effectively in these unstructured environments. Thus, providing adaptive support has great potential to help improve student learning with these rich activities. Providing adaptive support requires a student model that can both evaluate learning as well inform relevant feedback. Building such a model for interactive simulations is especially challenging because the exploratory nature of the interaction makes it hard to know a priori which behaviors are conducive to learning. To address this problem, in this paper we leverage the student modeling framework proposed in (Kardan and Conati, 2011) to specifically address the challenge of modeling students in interactive simulations. The framework has already been successfully applied to build a student model and to give adaptive interventions for an interactive simulation for constraint satisfaction. We seek to investigate the generality of the framework by building student models for a more complex simulation on electric circuits called Circuit Construction Kit (CCK). We evaluate alternative representations of logged interaction data with CCK, capturing different amounts of granularity and feature engineering. We then apply the student modeling framework proposed in (Kardan and Conati, 2011) to group students based on their interaction behaviors, map these behaviors into learning outcomes and leverage the resulting clusters to classify new learners. Data collected from 100 college students working with the CCK simulation indicates that the proposed framework is able to successfully classify students in groups of high and low learners and identify patterns of productive behaviors that are common across representations that can inform real-time feedback. In addition to presenting these results, we discuss trade-offs between levels of granularity and feature engineering in the tested interaction representations in terms of their ability to evaluate learning, classify students, and inform feedback.

This is especially important for complex ill-structured learning tasks, i.e. tasks that are characterized by having multiple good solutions (ill-structured), allowing individual learners to follow different routes for achieving the final learning objectives, and having non-evident interactions between the different concepts in the problem domain. Conceptual modelling is an example of such complex learning task as it requires rigorous analytical skills and experience to externalize requirements into high-quality formal representations - conceptual models. These skills are very difficult to teach to novice modellers mainly due to the lack of tools that can continuously guide them in the learning process. In this talk, I will report about the use of automated feedback and simuation to guide the student's learning process for conceptual modelling. Furthermore, lessons from student modelling behaviour as observed from logging the modelling process of students will be presented.

The available automata are modular structures of various origin (a robotic arm connected to an Arduino platform, and some Lego MindStorm builds, in various configurations). Such hardware is reasonably sophisticated in terms of functions, enjoys a wide provision of sensors and actuators, so allowing for presenting the learners with a good deal of problems, and is sufficiently affordable in terms of cost. Making the learner choose and sequence the problems to undertake, with the only limitation of the problem affordability measured by the student model, allows learners to follow a highly personalizable learning path in a pedagogically controlled setting, which we submit is conducive to better engagement and learning results.","",""

As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process the system engages in a process called model tracing. Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model the system identifies, or flags, that an error has occurred. This helps in the shorter feedback cycle for the student and help them in overcoming these shortcomings through the recommendation engine. The tutor model accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. Knowledge tracing tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The tutor system gives a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the know ledge tracing data and the skill meter are updated in real-time. The Another core feature of the tutor system is its recommendation engine which on the basis of the skill meter that is updated at the real time will find what all are the things that the student may be interested on and suggest him the path that could be more fruitful. And last the tutor system is able to builds student profiles while observing student performance throughout the interaction of the system.","",""

For learners engaged in self-study online distance learning, this may result in material being presented at either too high or too low cognitive levels. According to the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, this may result in either frustration or boredom among learners. This paper proposes a recommender-system-based adaptive e-learning framework for personalised teaching on e-learning platforms. The framework would assist designers, teachers and learners to identify issues they need to consider in order to address challenges of poor engagement in online distance settings, arising from a “one-size-fits-all” approach that does not recognise the role of individual differences in teaching and learning. Secondly, the framework may enable the identification of problems or obstacles that may be encountered when supporting learners in their quest to reduce frustration and boredom when using a Recommender-Based Pedagogical System (RBPS). A literature review was conducted on adaptive e-learning systems based on the ZPD theory, learner modelling, the Generic Adaptive Framework and a recommendation system model. 70 articles were selected from a database of 720 articles published between 2010 and 2017 to come up with the dimensions needed to develop such a model for the framework through deductive analysis. The research found out that the majority of the studies only consider three dimensions to an adaptive framework, that is, the learner model, the content model and the adaptation engine while the Generic Adaptation Framework proposes seven dimensions. In addition, the majority of the studies are based on the principles of macro-adaptation which provide a “static” snapshot of a learner's profile instead of dynamically adjusting the adaptation as learner variables. In the proposed adaptive framework, we identified five dimensions, including real-time dynamic adaptation and context modelling in addition to the learner model, the domain model and the pedagogical strategy.","",""

Methods used: conceptual and logical modeling of the е-learning of variability process with electronic educational resource of new generation and system analysis of the interconnection of the studied subject area, methods, didactics approaches and information and communication technologies means. Results: the formalization complex model of the е-learning of variability with electronic educational resource of new generation is developed, conditionally decomposed into three basic components: the formalization model of the course in the form of the thesaurusclassifier (“Author of e-resource”), the model of learning as management (“Coordination. Consultation. Control”), the learning model with the thesaurus-classifier (“Student”). Model “Author of e-resource” allows the student to achieve completeness, high degree of didactic elaboration and structuring of the studied material in triples of variants: modules of education information, practical task and control tasks; the result of the student’s (author’s of e-resource) activity is the thesaurus-classifier. Model of learning as management is based on the principle of personal orientation of learning in computer environment and determines the logic of interaction between the lecturer and the student when determining the triple of variants individually for each student; organization of a dialogue between the lecturer and the student for consulting purposes; personal control of the student’s success (report generation) and iterative search for the concept of the class assignment in the thesaurus-classifier before acquiring the required level of training. Model “Student” makes it possible to concretize the learning tasks in relation to the personality of the student and to the training level achieved; the assumption of the lecturer about the level of training of a particular student is formed using the reporting data of model as management. Theoretical provisions of variation e-learning, including its base tasks (teaching, learning, management), and also order, formallogical and program means of development and most important requirements for an effective electronic educational resource are grounded; it is shown that the formalization of educational resources is possible on the basis of the structural-mathematical approach using the set-theoretical representations, that allow defining the features of the educational process and the role of participants in the language of sets and mapping between them, and also to receive “pedagogical diagnostics” of the course and learning outcomes, using the intellectual potential of each trainee both personally and in the classroom.

Indeed, that has been a central aspect of the field from the beginning. Usage logs provided valuable insights into how systems were used and how effective they were for language learning. That information could be analyzed to improve instructional design and delivery. Maintaining learning histories and personal profiles of individual learners enabled a program to adapt the delivery of learning materials to the record of student performance. Given a limited number of users working within a single system, the data generated could be collected and analyzed easily, using simple methods and tools such as spreadsheets and basic data models. The situation today is quite different from that scenario. Learners are likely to be using multiple online tools and services, all of which may be recording data. That includes general use software and services such as Facebook and Google, as well as mobile devices. If they are university students, they are likely to be generating data points through a learning management system (LMS) as well as from other university-level systems. The vast amount of information collected today from our use of online tools and services provides a huge storehouse of information that can be mined to provide both general usage trends and individualized reports. This ""big data"" offers valuable teaching and learning insights. In this column, we will be looking at what this may mean in language learning. That will include discussion of the emerging field of learning analytics, the use of learner models, and the opportunities afforded by data tracking for personalized learning.","Second Language Learning; Second Language Instruction; Computer Assisted Instruction; Computer Software; Social Media; Teaching Methods; Profiles; Spreadsheets; Data Collection; Management Systems; Data Analysis",""

The first layer of this system records complicated and rhythmic movement of the trainer using a motion capture device. It solves an inverse kinematic problem with the help of an adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference system. Then it can achieve angles records of any joints involved in the desired motion. The trajectory is given as input to the systems second layer. The layer deals with extracting optimal parameters of the trajectories obtained from the first layer using a network of oscillator neurons and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. This system is capable to obtain any complex motion and rhythmic trajectory via first layer and learns rhythmic trajectories in the second layer then converge towards all these movements. Moreover, this two layer system is able to provide various features of a learner model, for instance resistance against perturbations, modulation of trajectories amplitude and frequency. The simulation results of the learning system is performed in the robot simulator WEBOTS linked with MATLAB software.

In this study we asked student pairs to reect on each other frequently during an UML analysis and design assignment.We qualitatively analysed these reections.We observed that this approach triggers reective thinking in our student modellers.

Using the benefits of the computer game in the classroom without conforming the didactical aspects, could produce results slightly different from the main pedagogical objectives. Because of the specific nature of the game and playing there are not established yet standards supporting the learning process based on computer games. This circumstance determines the complexity of the synthesis of a student model that is to be built in a learning game. This paper discusses the idea about a WEB based platform for learning game composing which follows a new model of the student in a learning game, based on a certain didactical model. Methods: The model is synthesized on the base of a preliminarily defined didactical model and outlines the basic fields, corresponding to the process of acquiring knowledge using a learning game. A substantial differences between traditional e-Learning and game based learning approaches are examined. Results: The basic concept and notation of the proposed student model is presented and further the model is described in details. The model is organized in three areas, reflecting activities, individualities and knowledge of the students: Interaction area, Archetype area and Competence area. The model areas are embraced by a Stimulus environment giving the context of the model, namely that the model represents a student who learns while playing a learning game. The main advantage of the model is the convergence of the computer game and the didactical approach in a stimulus environment for learning. The proposed model could be used not only for a learning game referred to a specific subject domain, but also for a WEB-based platform for interdisciplinary learning games composing.","Game Based Learning, Computer Learning Game, Student Model, Education, Platform for Learning Games Composing., Social Sciences, Higher Education, Educational Psychology",""

This approach entails evaluating student core competencies using the correspondence between courses and core competencies in a competency-based curriculum and students' taken courses and grades. On the basis of this approach, a curriculum-level, competency-based visualized analytic system, called visualized analytics of core competencies (VACCs), was implemented. Course-competency diagnostic tools, course work performance radar charts, and peer-based ranking tables were developed as part of the VACC analytic system for student reflection and to position their levels of core competencies. These curriculum-level open student models revealed multiple aspects of students' core competencies by monitoring the quantity and quality of courses taken by students, and evaluating students' ranks regarding core competencies compared with their classmates and graduates. VACC evaluation was conducted in this paper. The results showed that more than 70% of students reported that VACC helped in reflecting on their core competencies, assisting them in understanding the correspondence between their taken courses and core competencies, and helping them to set goals regarding taking additional courses. In addition, this paper discusses potential analytics and applications of open student models of core competencies.","Computing and Processing, Computational modeling, Analytical models, Data visualization, Reflection, Adaptation models, Visualization, Radar, Computers and education, learning analytics, learning dashboards, learning technologies, open student model",""

In this paper, a dashboard for visualizing and inspecting early detected reading difficulties and their characteristics, called PADA (acronym for the Spanish name Panel de Analíticas de Aprendizaje de Dislexia en Adultos), is presented. PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better understanding by students about their learner model. Through information visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their learner models in order to help them to increase their awareness and to support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in reading. PADA provides different learning analytics on reading performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning. This paper describes examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts, line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the students. We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic. The results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and help them to understand their difficulties associated with the reading tasks, as well as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the learning process.

OLMs surface the relationship between learning activities and tasks, formative and summative assessment, and intended learning outcomes.

Moreover, the approach one employs in diagnosing a clinical case is in some measure dependent upon the complexity of the case. This leads us to the question: Are there differences in the manner in which novices solve cases with varying levels of complexity in a computer-based learning environment?

Recommender Systems are more advanced in this aspect than Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and Intelligent Learning Environments (ILEs). A reason for this is that the user models of Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Intelligent Learning Environments, i.e. their student models, tend to be more heterogeneous and complex than traditional models used in Recommender Systems. To share and reuse student models we must first understand the restrictions for porting or reusing student models in new ITSs or ILEs. This paper proposes a classification of student models in terms of their portability. Portability is measured via each model’s accessibility, complexity, architecture, popularity, and description. We use this classification to analyse and then grade student models that have been published in the AIED, EDM and ITS research communities in 2013 and 2014. The classification is intended to be used by researchers both as a methodology to measure the portability of a student model and as a guide to find existing reusable models.","Intelligent tutoring systems, Sharing student models, Student modelling, Portability",""

There has been substantial research on tracking and modeling student learning, but significantly less attention on how to plan teaching actions and how the assumed student model impacts the resulting plans. We frame the problem of optimally selecting teaching actions using a decision-theoretic approach and show how to formulate teaching as a partially observable Markov decision process planning problem. This framework makes it possible to explore how different assumptions about student learning and behavior should affect the selection of teaching actions. We consider how to apply this framework to concept learning problems, and we present approximate methods for finding optimal teaching actions, given the large state and action spaces that arise in teaching. Through simulations and behavioral experiments, we explore the consequences of choosing teacher actions under different assumed student models. In two concept-learning tasks, we show that this technique can accelerate learning relative to baseline performance.

The architecture approach with model-oriented engineering, facilitates the 360° vision allowing us to analyze the interaction between various architecture components and specially the governability problem (all decision taking levels) for a University. It is itself a system that ensures compliance with government policies, rules and standards in a highly complex institution with intellectual assets and knowledge processes which are the typical ethos for a university. Several intelligent architectures (applications and tools) we have developed, for the analysis and solutions related to the following issues: Pedagogic Model, Academic Governability, Sustainability, Productivity (students, college authorities, and teachers), High Quality of HE including Strategic Planning and Prospective tools, HE Sector Competitiveness, including internationalization, Propaedeutic Cycles and their implications and Linking HE with media education (ME). These initiatives have been submitted to several international meetings of IEEE, ACM, ISTEC and also published as book chapters and books. The model of the student is another important achievement to have full implementation for each student individualized at the FUNDACIÓN DE EDUCACIÒN SUPERIOR SAN JOSÉ, FESSANJOSE, and both student self-control and his/her regulatory board. The architecture enables an iterative and dynamically cognitive development which is rich in personal information analysis for the improvement of the Pedagogic Model, the decision making of both student and teacher productivity. The Linear Programming with Leontief Input Output model focuses on organizational governance with its impact on university financial sustainability, knowledge generation and organizational learning to quality, productivity and competitiveness. As mentioned before student modeling involves 3 levels: Good Performance; Recoverable student, and the Deserter student. 1-Good Performance student and Permanence The Optimization problems involve more than one objective respectively. Our study allowed us to conclude that the re-situated Leontief Model, from the old inter-industry economy to the new inter-industry knowledge economy, is a way to analyze knowledge jointly with large volume of information coherently. At the same time the model allowed us to analyze problems as of Governability, Productivity, Competitiveness and Sustainability of HE.","",""

They evolve to retain pace with novelty on the internet. Therefore, requires calibration in the architecture of such system. However, in endeavoring to deliver the best services, research must prominence on enhancing the motivational strategies and recommendation techniques to boost user participation and trust over the system. To attain this goal, the open learner model with the tag base recommender system is implemented. It narrows down the search space and empowers the users with the maximum level of trust and satisfaction. Developing countries are eager consumers of digital libraries but the unavailability of resources, not consigned to becoming “read-only cultures” in the digital revolution and out-of-focus directions cause the digital divide. This proposed framework combines new motivational approaches with the integration of the best features of Digital Libraries, educational systems, and widespread resource sharing systems. To influence the effectiveness, learnability and convenience of a system, particular characteristics are syndicated. Pioneering consultation platform, news feed and membership strategies contribute in inspiring the users towards the system. Hence, it also diminishes all the weaknesses and flaws that have been disclosed in earlier researches regarding Digital Repositories.

The aim was for SMILI☺ to provide researchers with a systematic way to describe, compare and critique OLMs. We expected it to highlight those areas where there had been considerable OLM work, as well as those that had been neglected. However, we observed that SMILI☺ was not used in these ways. We now reflect on the reasons for this, and conclude that it has actually served a broader role in defining the notion of OLM and informing OLM design. Since the initial SMILI☺ paper, much has changed in technology-enhanced learning. Notably, learning technology has become far more pervasive, both in formal and lifelong learning. This provides huge, and still growing amounts of learning data. The fields of Learning Analytics (LA), Learning at Scale (L@S), Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Quantified Self (QS) have emerged. This paper argues that there has also been an important shift in the nature and role of learner models even within Artificial Intelligence in Education and Intelligent Tutoring Systems research. In light of these trends, and reflecting on the use of SMILI☺, this paper presents a revised and simpler version of SMILI☺ alongside the original version. In both cases there are additional categories to encompass new trends, which can be applied, omitted or substituted as required. We now offer this as a guide for designers of interfaces for OLMs, learning analytics and related fields, and we highlight the areas where there is need for more research.

In this paper we reflect on the influence of the PHelpS peer help system on our subsequent research agenda as well as some of the broader influences of our work. In particular, we discuss a number of research projects arising out of PHelpS directly or indirectly, including the I-Help (aka iHelp) system, a peer help system that has been widely deployed in university courses; a distributed multi-agent architecture for peer help systems that uses fragmented learner modelling to support its activities; the active user modelling paradigm which views 'learner model' as a computation not a knowledge structure; the ecological approach, a general architecture for learning systems in which patterns mined from learner interactions with learning objects inform pedagogical decisions; investigations, especially into privacy and reputation, arising from the large scale deployment of iHelp supported by evidence mined from iHelp data; and research into novel affective and social motivation techniques. We conclude by discussing the implications of the common perspective that has emerged from these interrelated research projects. This perspective views the goal of learning technology design to be to track learners as they carry out authentic activities, to deeply understand these learners and their learning context, and to provide just in time support for their learning.

For online courses that lack direct interpersonal contact, incorporating group learning into online learning can be more challenging than the traditional in-person courses. This resource consists of a structured multiple mini-team assignments. The idea of incorporating Wikipedia into the assignment was premised on the principle that students are more apt to gain a greater depth of knowledge when motivated by teaching others. Methods This activity is designed to be completed over a sequence of 8 weeks. The activity has historically complemented an online course; therefore, students complete components of the assignment in an unstructured time. Each component of the activity is designed to be completed in 3–5 hours. Students are required to have some baseline knowledge of the subject before beginning the project. Students also should be knowledgeable of proper sources of peer-reviewed information. Results This activity has been implemented a total of seven times in an online, 8-week format for the past 4 years. During that time, students have developed full-text reviews on a variety of health economics topics. Seventy percent of the students have voluntarily submitted their assignments to Wikipedia to add to a public repository.

Thus, learning process in every learner is also different. On the other hand, education requires every learner to achieve a certain standard of competency. Standards are made to ensure all learners meet the defined learning outcome. In order to help learner achieve the targeted competency based on their own pace and way of learning, we propose personalized e-learning architecture that complies with standard. This study explores various theories and best practices of e-learning and confronted with various ways of learning due to cultural diversity in Indonesia. The analysis reveals components that commonly play important part in personalization: integrated learning structure, learner model, personalized learning scenario, personalized content selection, and portfolio-based assessment. These five components are interrelated to compose personalized e-learning system. The proposed architecture facilitates various ways of learning as well as aligns with expected learning outcome. A prototype system of the proposed architecture will be built in future to show the contribution.","",""

The system suggests adaptations and the student also submits his/her adaptation preference. When the student preference opposes the system suggestion, the student then negotiates with the system to reach an agreement of adaptation. A negotiation-based adaptive learning system (NALS) is implemented to support the generation of personalized adaptive learning sequences by system negotiations with students regarding assessments of learning performance (i.e. negotiated open student model) of the current content and choices of the next learning content (i.e. negotiation of adaptation). Students require two metacognitions in deciding adaptive learning sequences: self-assessment for evaluating their understanding of the current content and regulation for choosing appropriate learning content. Negotiated open student model are used for assist student self-assessment and negotiation of adaptation are used for assist student regulation of content choices. An experiment was conducted to compare a system-controlled adaptive learning system (SALS, adaptivity), a user-controlled adaptive learning system (UALS, adaptability), and a NALS. The results revealed that NALS promoted better metacognitions in student calibration (i.e. self-assessment) accuracy and learning content choices (i.e. regulation). Preliminary evidences also showed that NALS promoted better student performance in a delay test. The results further suggested that students with poor calibration accuracy and inappropriate content choices were not suitable to use UALS and were suitable to use SALS. The NALS can also be used for training students to make appropriate adaptation for learning.","Architectures for educational technology system, Evaluation of CAL systems, Intelligent tutoring systems, Interactive learning environments",""

In this context, one major research point – and a challenge – is to efficiently discover students’ learning styles. But, the test and validation of new approaches in this field requires substantial amounts of financial, human resources (tutors and students) and time. In this way, the use of simulated students for test and validation of new approaches in this field is very important. Therefore, this work depicts the implementation and use of simulation for empirical evaluation of three different strategies for automatic learning styles modelling. It was necessary to compare the efficiency of the strategies, in order to choose the best one. Therefore, it was needed a practical mechanism to evaluate and compare them, preferably without the engagement of human resources. Then, the main goal of using simulation in this work is to compare strategies’ efficiency and to discover the most promising one. The research was empirical, and has led to considerable enhancements on an intelligent component for automatic modelling of learning and teaching styles, which has been tested, adjusted and improved in a reasonable time and with low cost.

This component based (e.g., Singley & Anderson, 1989) approach has been employed in psychometrics (Tatsuoka, 1983), cognitive science (Koedinger & MacLaren, 2002), and most recently in educational data mining (Cen, Koedinger, & Junker, 2006). A typical assumption of these theory based models is that an itemization of “knowledge components” shared between tasks is sufficient to predict transfer between these tasks. In this paper we step back from these more cognitive theory based models of transfer and suggest a psychometric measurement model that removes most cognitive assumptions, thus allowing us to understand the data without the bias of a theory of transfer or domain knowledge. The goal of this work is to help provide a methodology that allows researchers to analyse complex data without the theoretical assumptions clearly part of other methods. Our experimentally controlled examples illustrate the non-intuitive nature of some transfer situations which motivates the necessity of the unbiased analysis that our model provides. We explain how to use this Contextual Performance Factors Analysis (CPFA) model to measure learning progress of related skills at a fine granularity. This CPFA analysis then allows us to answer questions regarding the best order of practice for related skills and the appropriate amount of repetition depending on whether students are succeeding or failing with each individual practice problem. We conclude by describing how the model allows us to test theories, in which we discuss how well two different cognitive theories agree with the qualitative results of the model.","Human learning, Pedagogical strategy, Transfer of learning, Student modelling",""

After successful model calibration and model validation to a German mesoscale catchment, the ‘student’ model is applied to quantify the impact of regional climate change scenarios on the water budget of the Wiehl drinking water reservoir. The simulation results show that the conceptual ‘student model’ performs well for both calibration and validation periods. It well represents the variability in water flows at different timescales and therefore has the potential to be used for scenario analysis. The ‘student model’ shows a comparable reaction to climate change scenarios as sophisticated hydrological catchment models did which were applied to neighboured catchments in North Rhine-Westphalia based on the same underlying parent scenarios. The magnitude of the simulated climate impacts on seasonal water balances and extreme flows indicates that current reservoir management needs to be adjusted to the projected variability of inflows to the reservoir. Despite its simplicity, the ‘student model’ can have a high value for reservoir management. It well represents the inflow into the reservoir based on available data and provides a reliable estimate of climate change impacts, indicating the necessity of adjustment of the operation rules in the future. At the same time it remains transparent to the model users, offering a simple but realistic training tool for the generation of reservoir inflow time series. It therefore can contribute to the solution of recent hydrological and water management problems. Restrictions of such models are due to the lumped nature and the limited applicability for a priori predictions.","Conceptual catchment model, Education, Water management, Climate impact, Reservoir management",""

In this paper, an intelligent advice generation module is presented. As a testbed for our research, we have incorporated the advice generation mechanism in a Facebook application for language learning. A significant feature in the proposed framework of advice generation is user modeling. The advice generation is required to reason about the students' knowledge status and to decide appropriate advice. Actions, recorded by the application and transformed by the student modeler into student models, serve as the source from which diagnostic information about the student can be extracted. This information indicates which concepts were presented to the student, the duration of time the student spent working with learning objects related to a specific concept, which concepts probably mastered by the student and which concepts not yet mastered. The advice generation can identify the status of students and groups of students. This is used as a source for the generation of appropriate advice to the course instructor, who can then pass the advice to the students or consequently take some pedagogical actions that should be educationally appropriate.

However, recent studies conducted in Indian metros have expressed concern about students' mathematics learning. Except in some private coaching academies, regular classroom teaching does not include problem solving in mathematics, but is limited to mere practice exercises and drills of known exercises. For describing mathematical thinking, Schoenfeld gave a framework containing four components: resources, heuristics, controls and beliefs. Beginning in childhood we develop an ontology for the ideas we learn, and this ontology evolves as we continue learning. Ontologies used for teaching need to incorporate elements of mathematical thinking popularized by problem solving experts. So teaching that makes use of such ontologies of problems, problem solving strategies, and tasks would be beneficial to students. In this paper we identify the gaps in the literature on teaching problem solving, and discuss how and why ontologies can be used for teaching problem solving in mathematics at the high school level. As a proof of concept, we describe the method by which an ontology named MONTO has been created for teaching problem solving in mathematics, and give examples of its use. We describe the MONTO ontology and compare it with some other teaching ontologies described in the literature. We developed and evaluated the MONTO ontology for Surface Area and Volume (3D Solids) problems taught as part of the national curriculum in India, and the results obtained were satisfactory: MONTO was found to be 94% robust against unseen problems in different curricula for the same domain.

However, recent studies conducted in Indian metros have expressed concern about students' mathematics learning. Except in some private coaching academies, regular classroom teaching does not include problem solving in mathematics, but is limited to mere practice exercises and drills of known exercises. For describing mathematical thinking, Schoenfeld gave a framework containing four components: resources, heuristics, controls and beliefs. Beginning in childhood we develop an ontology for the ideas we learn, and this ontology evolves as we continue learning. Ontologies used for teaching need to incorporate elements of mathematical thinking popularized by problem solving experts. So teaching that makes use of such ontologies of problems, problem solving strategies, and tasks would be beneficial to students. In this paper we identify the gaps in the literature on teaching problem solving, and discuss how and why ontologies can be used for teaching problem solving in mathematics at the high school level. As a proof of concept, we describe the method by which an ontology named MONTO has been created for teaching problem solving in mathematics, and give examples of its use. We describe the MONTO ontology and compare it with some other teaching ontologies described in the literature. We developed and evaluated the MONTO ontology for Surface Area and Volume (3D Solids) problems taught as part of the national curriculum in India, and the results obtained were satisfactory: MONTO was found to be 94% robust against unseen problems in different curricula for the same domain.","Teaching problem solving, Pedagogy ontology, Ontology-based student model, Application of ontology, Knowledge representation, Domain ontologies, Mathematics education, Problem solving, Mathematical problems, Mathematical knowledge, Word problems, Semantics, Tutoring, Knowledge representation, Parametric models",""

This paper examines some of the issues relevant to these challenges through the development of the ICON (Instructional Cultural cONtextualisation) system. The paper explores computational approaches for modelling the diversity of students within subcultures, and the necessary semantic formalisms for representing and reasoning about cultural backgrounds at an appropriate level of granularity for ILEs. The paper investigates how student-initiated control of dynamic cultural adaptation of educational content can be achieved in ILEs, and examines the effects of cultural variations of language formality and contextualisation on student preferences for different types of educational content. Evaluations revealed preliminary insight into quantifiable thresholds at which student perception for specific types of culturally-contextualised content vary.

After successful model calibration and model validation to a German mesoscale catchment, the ‘student’ model is applied to quantify the impact of regional climate change scenarios on the water budget of the Wiehl drinking water reservoir. The simulation results show that the conceptual ‘student model’ performs well for both calibration and validation periods. It well represents the variability in water flows at different timescales and therefore has the potential to be used for scenario analysis. The ‘student model’ shows a comparable reaction to climate change scenarios as sophisticated hydrological catchment models did which were applied to neighboured catchments in North Rhine-Westphalia based on the same underlying parent scenarios. The magnitude of the simulated climate impacts on seasonal water balances and extreme flows indicates that current reservoir management needs to be adjusted to the projected variability of inflows to the reservoir. Despite its simplicity, the ‘student model’ can have a high value for reservoir management. It well represents the inflow into the reservoir based on available data and provides a reliable estimate of climate change impacts, indicating the necessity of adjustment of the operation rules in the future. At the same time it remains transparent to the model users, offering a simple but realistic training tool for the generation of reservoir inflow time series. It therefore can contribute to the solution of recent hydrological and water management problems. Restrictions of such models are due to the lumped nature and the limited applicability for a priori predictions.

This approach is fully implemented and evaluated in an educational application module, called fuzzy knowledge state definer (FuzKSD). In particular, FuzKSD performs user modeling by dynamically identifying and updating a student's knowledge level of all the concepts of the domain knowledge. The operation of FuzKSD is based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) that are used to represent the dependences among the domain concepts. FuzKSD uses fuzzy sets to represent a student's knowledge level as a subset of the domain knowledge. Thus, it combines fuzzy theory with the overlay model. Moreover, it employs a novel inference mechanism that dynamically updates user stereotypes using fuzzy sets. It should be noted that the overlay model and stereotypes constitute two widely used methods for user modeling. However, they have not been combined with fuzzy sets thus far in the literature. The gain from this novel combination is significant as a student level of knowledge is represented in a more realistic way by automatically modeling the learning or forgetting process of a student with respect to the FCMs and thus the system can provide individualized adaptive advice. The application of this approach is not limited to adaptive instruction. It can also be used in other systems with changeable user states, such as e-shops, where consumers' preferences change over time and affect one another. Therefore, the particular module constitutes a novel generic fuzzy tool, which offers dynamic adaptation to users' needs and preferences of adaptive systems.","Computing and Processing, Adaptation models, Fuzzy logic, Adaptive systems, Fuzzy sets, Materials, Electronic learning, Computer languages, programming, Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), fuzzy sets, student model, personalization",""

In this paper, we present a semantic web based adaptive educational system that is developed to assist the students in learning the challenging subjects of the Artificial Intelligence course. The system utilizes ontologies to represent the domain of the course's curriculum and the student model. Also, the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules are used for making decisions on the learning activities to propose to the student according to his/her profile and knowledge level. The evaluation results indicate quite promising performance regarding the system's learning capabilities and functionality.","",""

In the model, the first stage of the pre-test-practice post-test evaluation protocol is used to initialize the student model needed for adaptation. In order to keep assessment congruent with learning, the same type of activity is used in all three stages of evaluation, and the software tutor itself is used to administer all three stages of the protocol. In order to minimize time while maximizing learning, post-test is set to adapt to practice, and students are also provided feedback after pre-test activities on which they provide incorrect response. Finally, the software tutor is set up to administer the pre-test-practice-post-test protocol as one seamless integrated session with no discernible breaks between the stages. This model of deployment helps the developer evaluate the effectiveness of the software tutor, helps the student minimize time while maximizing learning and enables the instructor to obtain concept-level summary of what worked and what needs to be reviewed again in the classroom. The deployment model has been implemented in software tutors for programming, called problets (problets.org). We produce quantitative data from three problets used in spring 2013 to illustrate the benefits of the deployment model that accrue to developers, students and instructors.","",""

In addition, access to information requires the use of web tools for information retrieval (IR). Many methods from traditional IR were extended to structured documents. On the other hand, approaches have been proposed to regard specifically semantics in structured documents by using external semantic resources while collecting original documents on which it is necessary to provide semantic similarity measures in order to perform comparisons between concepts. Most previous approaches did not take into account the relations between concepts and are not tailored to the specific needs of learners. In this paper a semantic IR system of structured educational documents is proposed and adapted to the needs and preferences of the learner.

An LLM was initiated in which pharmacists supervise pharmacy residents and students in a team format in which students are used as pharmacist extenders. CCF partnered with local and regional colleges of pharmacy to increase the number of advanced pharmacy practice experience student rotations at CCF. Students are given accountability for a specific number of patient beds based on their rotation. They are required to perform medication histories, education on drug indication and adverse effects, discharge counseling, targeted disease counseling, and profile review for drug-related problems for their patients. After the implementation of this model, improvements were observed in Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores (58% versus 70%, respectively), pharmacy interventions per patient per day (0.9 versus 1.4, respectively), and bedside medication delivery capture rate (48% versus 65%, respectively).; Conclusion: The implementation of an LLM and partnering with local colleges of pharmacy have improved pharmacy practice at CCF by allowing pharmacy students to work as pharmacist extenders in providing comprehensive pharmacy services to many patients who would not otherwise be reached. This approach has improved HCAHPS scores within the ""communication of medication"" domain, increased overall patient interventions, and allowed expansion of CCF's discharge prescription program.

One of the main functions of an ITS system is to present its students with course materials that are most appropriate to their current knowledge of domain concepts, example being one of the course materials. ITS systems typically compare and analyze student model (SM) components for student's current knowledge of concepts (main topics, e.g. Scanf in C programming) that are required to understand the next example (e.g. Codes for scanf) suitable for learning a task (e.g. Write C code to read 2 integers from the keyboard). Existing systems such as NavEx and PADS perform an exhaustive matching of student knowledge level with all examples in the database. This research proposes a task-based technique for managing and classifying examples for more effective retrieval of relevant examples for learning a task. We propose a system called EASK for translating task and example solutions into concepts for similarity matching, which is more readily available, easily extendible and adaptable to other domains. Examples and tasks are represented as vectors of weights computed with term frequency measure TFIDF that signify the importance of a concept for an example. Examples most similar to a task are found by using a classification method called k-NN, which finds the closeness between different objects such as examples and tasks using cosine similarity measure and selecting the k objects (examples) with highest similarity scores. As a by-product, k-NN also predicts the class label (difficulty level) of the task. Our proposed model achieves this prediction with 89% accuracy.","",""

(2) The “teachable agent”—Elle—begins not with a tabula rasa but rather with an understanding of the domain content which is close to the human student’s. (3) Most importantly, Elle never actually learns anything directly from the human tutor! Instead, there is a super-agent (Cyc) which already knows the domain content extremely well.

It uses that Socratically to decide what Elle’s current mental model should be (what concepts and skills Elle should already know, and what sorts of mistakes it should make) so as to best help the user to overcome their current confusions. All changes to the Elle model are made by BELLA, not by the user—the only learning going on is BELLA learning more about the user—but from the user’s point of view it often appears as though Elle were attending to them and learning from them.

In contrast, adaptive e-learning systems can enhance learning by taking into account different learner characteristics and by personalising learning material. Although a large number of systems incorporating learning style have been deployed, there is a lack of comprehensive, comparative evaluations. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by comparing a number of adaptive e-learning systems. It considers three main perspectives: the learner model, the domain model and the adaptation model.

When multiple representations are presented across consecutive problems, we have to decide in what sequence to present them. Prior research has demonstrated that interleaving tasks types (as opposed to blocking them) can foster learning. Do the same advantages apply to interleaving representations? We addressed this question using a variety of research methods. First, we conducted a classroom experiment with an intelligent tutoring system for fractions. We compared four practice schedules of multiple graphical representations: blocked, fully interleaved, moderately interleaved, and increasingly interleaved. Based on data from 230 4th and 5th-grade students, we found that interleaved practice leads to better learning outcomes than blocked practice on a number of measures. Second, we conducted a think-aloud study to gain insights into the learning mechanisms underlying the advantage of interleaved practice. Results show that students make connections between representations only when explicitly prompted to do so (and not spontaneously). This finding suggests that reactivation, rather than abstraction, is the main mechanism to account for the advantage of interleaved practice. Third, we used methods derived from Bayesian knowledge tracing to analyze tutor log data from the classroom experiment. Modeling latent measures of students' learning rates, we find higher learning rates for interleaved practice than for blocked practice. This finding extends prior research on practice schedules, which shows that interleaved practice (compared to blocked practice) impairs students' problem-solving performance during the practice phase when using raw performance measures such as error rates. Our findings have implications for the design of multi-representational learning materials and for research on adaptive practice schedules in intelligent tutoring systems.

One of the primary aims of this research is the construction of student models which promote the misconception diagnosis. Furthermore, they are the key for collaboration, given that students can cooperate with their peers, discuss complex problems from various perspectives and use knowledge to answer questions and/or to solve problems. Summarizing, in this paper, a mobile tutoring framework, built up in the context of student collaboration, is presented. Collaborative student groups are created with respect to the corresponding user models.

Thus, the game flow can be optimized to increase efficiency and effectiveness of gaming and learning in parallel. In the field of gaming still the Bartle model is commonly used due to its simplicity and good mapping to game scenarios, for learning the Learning Style Inventory from Kolb or Index of Learning Styles by Felder and Silverman are well known. For personality traits the NEO-FFI (Big5) model is widely accepted. When designing games, it is always a challenge to assess one player's profile characteristics properly in all three models (player/learner/personality). To reduce the effort and amount of dimensions and questionnaires a player might have to fill out, we proved the hypothesis that both, Learning Style Inventory and Bartle Player Types could be predicted by knowing the personality traits based on NEO-FFI. Thus we investigated the statistical correlations among the models by collecting answers to the questionnaires of Bartle Test, Kolb LSI 3.1 and BFI-K (short version of NEO-FFI). A study was conducted in spring 2012 with six school classes of grade 9 (12-14 year old students) in two different secondary schools in Germany. 74 students participated in the study which was offered optionally after the use of a game-based learning tool for peer learning. We present the results statistics and correlations among the models as well as the interdependencies with the student's level of proficiency and their social connectedness. In conclusion, the evaluation (correlation and regression analyses) proved the independency of the models and the validity of the dimensions. Still, especially for all of the playing style preferences of Bartle's model significant correlations with some of the analyzed other questionnaire items could be found. As no predictions of learning style preferences is possible on the basis of this studies data, the final recommendation for the development of game-based learning application concludes that separate modeling for the adaptation game flow (playing) and learn flow (learning) is still necessary.","Foreign Countries; Secondary School Students; Grade 9; Games; Predictor Variables; Models; Cognitive Style; Measures (Individuals); Personality Traits; Hypothesis Testing; Correlation; Questionnaires; Regression (Statistics); Validity; Preferences; Personality Measures, Germany, Learning Style Inventory; NEO Five Factor Inventory",""

They have been developed for diverse subject areas (e.g., algebra, medicine, law, reading) to help learners acquire domain-specific, cognitive and metacognitive knowledge. A meta-analysis was conducted on research that compared the outcomes from students learning from ITS to those learning from non-ITS learning environments. The meta-analysis examined how effect sizes varied with type of ITS, type of comparison treatment received by learners, type of learning outcome, whether knowledge to be learned was procedural or declarative, and other factors. After a search of major bibliographic databases, 107 effect sizes involving 14,321 participants were extracted and analyzed. The use of ITS was associated with greater achievement in comparison with teacher-led, large-group instruction (g = .42), non-ITS computer-based instruction (g = .57), and textbooks or workbooks (g = .35). There was no significant difference between learning from ITS and learning from individualized human tutoring (g = -.11) or small-group instruction (g = .05). Significant, positive mean effect sizes were found regardless of whether the ITS was used as the principal means of instruction, a supplement to teacher-led instruction, an integral component of teacher-led instruction, or an aid to homework. Significant, positive effect sizes were found at all levels of education, in almost all subject domains evaluated, and whether or not the ITS provided feedback or modeled student misconceptions. The claim that ITS are relatively effective tools for learning is consistent with our analysis of potential publication bias.","Processus acquisition, Acquisition process, Proceso adquisición, Ampleur effet, Effect size, Tamaño del efecto, Apprentissage, Learning, Aprendizaje, Article synthèse, Review, Artículo síntesis, Enseignement assisté ordinateur, Computer assisted teaching, Enseñanza asistida por computador, Etudiant, Student, Estudiante, Homme, Human, Hombre, Métaanalyse, Metaanalysis, Meta-análisis, Environnements informatiques pour l'apprentissage humain, Tutorat, Tutoring, Tutoria, Intelligent Tutoring System, effect size, meta-analysis, student model, Sciences biologiques et medicales, Biological and medical sciences, Sciences biologiques fondamentales et appliquees.

The outcome from such data analysis will be dependent on the range, type, and quality of available data and the type of analysis performed. This study reviewed factors that could be used to predict academic performance, but which are currently not systematically measured in tertiary education. It focused on psychometric factors of ability, personality, motivation, and learning strategies. Their respective relationships with academic performance are enumerated and discussed. A case is made for their increased use in learning analytics to enhance the performance of existing student models. It is noted that lack of independence, linear additivity, and constant variance in the relationships between psychometric factors and academic performance suggests increasing relevance of data mining techniques, which could be used to provide useful insights on the role of such factors in the modelling of learning process.","Psychometrics; Data Analysis; Academic Achievement; Postsecondary Education; Educational Research; Data Collection; Learning Processes; Learning Strategies; Cognitive Ability; Electronic Learning; Motivation; Correlation; Grade Point Average; Hierarchical Linear Modeling; Regression (Statistics); Bayesian Statistics; College Students; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Self Efficacy",""

The authors of the Focus article provide examples of these roles for more-conventional tasks (math word problems) and for a game-based formative assessment, ""Newton's Playground."" While the Focus article emphasizes structure--the roles of these variables and the relation of these variables to the rest of the assessment design, Bauer's commentary addresses aspects of ECD that are complementary to the article, specifically aspects of process (How does one create a design involving task model variables? What is the dynamic relation between the student-model, evidence-model, and task-model variables as they are developed and revised?). While the structures described in Almond et al. provide the ""what"" of evidence-centered assessment design, Bauer describes the intent of this commentary as more of a discussion about the design process itself-that is, the ""how"" that leads to these useful structures.","Task Analysis; Models; Design Requirements; Educational Games; Computer Games",""

It enables to recognize the student's learning style automatically in real time by means of Multi Layer Feed-Forward Neural network (MLFF). The MLFF is embedded to the system because of its ability to generalize and learn from specific examples, ability to be quickly updated with extra parameters, and speed in execution, making it suitable for real time applications. The system then enables to present and recommends a variety of learning contents adaptively towards each of the student's learning style identified in the student model through the adaptation model. The system then analyzes the learning content on each of the learning material, and then comes up with the generated teaching strategies by means of the teaching strategy generator and fragment sorting. The result of that analysis is called domain model. The adaptation model enables the system to adaptively presents the content, based on the student's learning style by combining the fragment sorting and adaptive annotation technique. The course player in ULUL-ILM enables the system to adaptively presents the content with various teaching strategies towards each of student's learning style.

Many school nurses have less confidence in managing some neurological conditions, thus identifying a need for continuing education. Education around a broad spectrum of common child neurology conditions can help school nurses blend educational, medical, and health services action plans. A curriculum was developed based upon the Child Neurology Telephone Encounter Guides (Sprague-McRae, Rosenblum, & Morrison, 2009). The curriculum uses the Child Neurology Process-Oriented Triage conceptual framework (Rosenblum & Sprague-McRae, 2009) and the Healthy Learner Model (Erickson, Splett, Mullett, & Heiman, 2006) to promote and maintain student health. This collection of child neurology educational and assessment content guides school nurses through in-person or telephone interactions with health care providers, students, and parents for selected child neurology issues.","Curriculum*, Education, Nursing, Continuing*, Nervous System Diseases/*nursing, School Nursing/*education, Child, Health Promotion, Humans, Triage",""

Previous studies have shown that solving problems in a blocked order, in which all problems of one type are completed before the student is switched to the next problem type, results in less effective performance than does solving the problems in an interleaved order. However, we have no precise understanding of the reason for this effect. In addition to existing theoretical results, we use a machine-learning agent that learns cognitive skills from examples and problem solving experience, SimStudent, to provide a computational model of the problem order question. We conduct a controlled simulation study in three different math and science domains (i.e., fraction addition, equation solving and stoichiometry), where SimStudent is tutored by automatic tutors given problems that have been used to teach human students. We compare two problem orders: the blocked problem order, and the interleaved problem order. The results show that the interleaved problem order yields as effective or more effective learning in all three domains, because the interleaved problem order provides more or better opportunities for error detection and correction to the learning agent. Examination of the agent’s performance shows that learning when to apply a skill benefits more from interleaved problem orders, and suggests that learning how to apply a skill benefits more from blocked problem orders.","Learning transfer, Learner modeling, Interleaved problem order, Blocked problem order",""

First, extracting the variables that represent a student's engagement in learning and defining the causal relationships among them can be difficult. Such variables are often implicit due to the unobservable nature of mental model. Second, identifying the evidence from student interaction log to infer a student's engagement level is also a major challenge. Such challenge stemmed mainly because students are granted the freedom to formulate and evaluate hypotheses in computer-based scientific inquiry learning environments, not all interactions can be useful to infer the student's engagement level. As such, the assumption that the frequency of interactions correlates with the level of student engagement can often be misleading. Therefore, this research work attempted to identify the variables of student engagement and to determine the Bayesian Network that can capture the causal relationships between the variables. In this study, two variations of Bayesian Network model were handcrafted with the prior probabilities learned using the interaction logs of 54 students. The predictive accuracy of proposed models were benchmarked against Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. The empirical findings showed that the Bayesian Network model with convergence arc directions outperformed other models, suggesting it is an optimal model for modeling student engagement in INQPRO.","",""

This study examines a two student to one faculty ATOM teaching model.; Materials and Methods: We randomly assigned 16 residents to four experienced ATOM faculty members. Half started with the one-student model and the other half with the two-student model and then switched using the same faculty. Students and faculty completed forms on the educational value of the two models (1 = very poor; 2 = poor; 3 = average; 4 = good; and 5 = excellent) and identified educational preferences and recommendations.; Results: We assigned educational values for the 13 procedures as follows: All faculty rated the one-student model as excellent; six members rated the two-student model as excellent, and seven as good. Students rated 50%-75% as excellent and 12%-44% as good for the two-student model, and 56%-81% as excellent and 12%-44% as good for the one-student model. Given resource constraints, all faculty and 88% of students preferred the two-student model. With no resource constraints, 75% of students and 50% of faculty chose the two-student model. All faculty and students rated both models ""acceptable."" Overall, 81% of students and 50% of faculty rated the two-student model better. All faculty members recommended that the models be optional; 94% of students recommended that they be either optional (50%) or a two-student model (44%). Performing or assisting on each procedure twice was considered an advantage of the two-student model.; Conclusions: The two-student teaching model was acceptable and generally preferred in this study. With appropriately trained faculty and students, the two-student model is feasible and should result in less animal usage and possibly wider promulgation. (Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This paper describes an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that focuses on this stage of the problem solving process. On the one hand, a domain specific inference engine and a knowledge representation mechanism are proposed. These are based on a description language based on hypergraphs, and the idea of using conceptual schemes to represent the student’s knowledge. As a result, the system is able to simultaneously: (a) represent all potential algebraic solutions to a given word problem; (b) keep track of the student’s actions; (c) univocally determine the current state of the resolution process; (d) build a student model; and (e) provide adaptive automatic remediation. On the other hand, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been designed to force the student to follow the sequence of steps described in the Cartesian method. The ITS has been evaluated in an educational environment. The results show significant gains for the experimental group and hence support the use of the ITS in practice.","Intelligent tutoring system, Problem solving, Algebra, Knowledge representation, Hypergraph",""

Regardless of their necessity and benefit, science seems to be difficult for some students, as a result of the mathematical representations and problem solving used in scientific inquiry. In this regard, several studies have attributed students' decreasing interest in science to the presence of these mathematical representations. In order to better understand student learning difficulties caused by mathematical components, the current study investigates student understanding of a familiar science concept and its mathematical component (pH value and logarithms). Student responses to a questionnaire and a follow-up interview were examined in detail. ""Measure"" and ""concentration"" were key criteria for students' understanding of pH values. In addition, only a few students understood logarithms on a meaningful level. According to students' understanding of scientific phenomena and mathematical structures, five different student models and the critical features of each type were identified. Further analysis revealed the existence of three domains that characterize these five types: object, operation, and function.

In the intervention, teachers received written curriculum materials about mathematical modeling. The concept underlying the materials was based on constructivist ideas and findings from mathematics education. Teacher beliefs about mathematics, learning and self-efficacy were expected to have a major impact on their classroom practices. We therefore assessed teacher beliefs about the usefulness of mathematics, learning (constructivist and socio-constructivist beliefs) and teacher self-efficacy when teaching modeling (teacher or class level variable). The student level variables assessed were modeling competence and other individual factors, such as basic mathematical skills and cognitive abilities. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured in a pre-post control group design using multilevel structural equation modeling. The results showed no direct effect of the intervention on student modeling competence. However, they did reveal that the intervention had a significant effect on teacher beliefs about learning (constructivist and socio-constructivist view) and an effect of these teacher beliefs about learning on student modeling competence. Further, the results showed that students' gains in modeling competence is not only mediated by teacher beliefs, but also influenced by individual factors. Implications for teaching as well as limitations of the study are discussed.","Mathematical Models; Teacher Attitudes; Beliefs; Intervention; Mathematics; Learning; Self Efficacy; Constructivism (Learning); Mathematics Instruction; Competence; Pretests Posttests; Structural Equation Models; Secondary School Teachers; Secondary School Students; Foreign Countries; Correlation; Instructional Effectiveness; Instructional Materials; Statistical Analysis; Questionnaires, Germany",""

Towards accomplishing this goal, we generated machine-learned models that can detect when students test their articulated hypotheses, design controlled experiments, and engage in planning behaviors using two inquiry support tools. Models were trained using labels generated through a new method of manually hand-coding log files, “text replay tagging”. This approach led to detectors that can automatically and accurately identify these inquiry skills under student-level cross-validation. The resulting detectors can be applied at run-time to drive scaffolding intervention. They can also be leveraged to automatically score all practice attempts, rather than hand-classifying them, and build models of latent skill proficiency. As part of this work, we also compared two approaches for doing so, Bayesian Knowledge-Tracing and an averaging approach that assumes static inquiry skill level. These approaches were compared on their efficacy at predicting skill before a student engages in an inquiry activity, predicting performance on a paper-style multiple choice test of inquiry, and predicting performance on a transfer task requiring data collection skills. Overall, we found that both approaches were effective at estimating student skills within the environment. Additionally, the models’ skill estimates were significant predictors of the two types of inquiry transfer tests.","Scientific inquiry, Exploratory learning environment assessment, Skill prediction, Machine-learned models, Microworlds, Behavior detection, Designing and conducting experiments, Bayesian Knowledge-Tracing",""

AutoTutor is an intelligent tutoring system that helps students compose explanations of difficult concepts in Newtonian physics and enhances computer literacy and critical thinking by interacting with them in natural language with adaptive dialog moves similar to those of human tutors. AutoTutor constructs a cognitive model of students' knowledge levels by analyzing the text of their typed or spoken responses to its questions. The model is used to dynamically tailor the interaction toward individual students' zones of proximal development. Affective AutoTutor takes the individualized instruction and human-like interactivity to a new level by automatically detecting and responding to students' emotional states in addition to their cognitive states. Over 20 controlled experiments comparing AutoTutor with ecological and experimental controls such reading a textbook have consistently yielded learning improvements of approximately one letter grade after brief 30--60-minute interactions. Furthermore, Affective AutoTutor shows even more dramatic improvements in learning than the original AutoTutor system, particularly for struggling students with low domain knowledge. In addition to providing a detailed description of the implementation and evaluation of AutoTutor and Affective AutoTutor, we also discuss new and exciting technologies motivated by AutoTutor such as AutoTutor-Lite, Operation ARIES, GuruTutor, DeepTutor, MetaTutor, and AutoMentor. We conclude this article with our vision for future work on interactive and engaging intelligent tutoring systems.","Intelligent tutoring systems, affect detection and synthesis, affective computing, constructivism, deep learning, natural language understanding, student modeling, user modeling",""

In the work presented here, we have used the GBSM to define Bayesian Student Models (BSMs) for a concrete domain: first degree equations. In order to test the diagnosis capabilities of such BSMs, an evaluation with 152 students has been performed. Each of the 152 students took both a computerized test within PMatE and a written exam, both of them designed to measure students' knowledge in 12 concepts related to first degree equations. The written exam was graded by three experts. Then two BSMs were developed, one for the computer test and another one for the written exam. These BSMs were used to obtain estimations of student's knowledge on the same 12 concepts, and the inter-rater agreement among the different measures was computed. Results show a high degree of agreement among the scores given by the experts and also among the diagnosis provided by the BSM in the written exam and expert's average, but a low degree of agreement among the diagnosis provided by the BSM in the computer test and expert's average.","Computerized testing, Bayesian networks, Student modeling",""

Our CUSP (Course and Unit of Study Portal) system tackles this challenge, by helping subject teachers define the curriculum of their subject, linking it to Faculty and institutional goals. The same information is available to students, enabling them to see how each subject relates to those goals. It then gives additional big-picture views of the degree for the academics responsible for the whole degree, including the ability to easily assess if a degree meets accreditation requirements. CUSP achieves this by exploiting a lightweight semantic mapping approach that gives a highly flexible and scalable way to map learning goals from multiple internal and external accrediting sources across the degree. We report its validation as used in a live university environment, across three diverse faculties, with 277 degrees and 7,810 subject sessions over a period of three years. Data from this evaluation indicates steady improvement in the documentation of the relationships between subjects, assessments, learning outcomes, and program level goals. This is driven by the reporting tools and visualizations provided by CUSP, which enable program designers and lecturers to identify parts of the curriculum that are unclear. This improved documentation of the curriculum enables more accurate and immediate quality reviews. Key contributions of this work are: a validated new approach for curriculum design that helps address the complexity of ensuring learners progressively develop generic skills; and a validated lightweight semantic mapping approach that can flexibly support visualizing the curriculum against multiple sets of learning goal frameworks.","Computing and Processing, Education courses, Accreditation, Computer science education, Education, Electronic learning, learner model, Curriculum mapping, graduate attributes, accreditation competencies",""

Evaluation of the student model of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) is an aspect for which there are not clear guidelines to be provided by literature. Therefore, we choose to use two well-known evaluation methods for the evaluation of our fuzzy student model, in order to design an accurate and correct evaluation methodology. These evaluation models are: the Kirkpatrick’s model and the layered evaluation method.

The model is designed so to send automated reminders to all users, according their activity in the period of two weeks. One additional analysis after the mid-term exams checks if activity matches performance. It has crucial role in directing both students and educators towards the common goal: success at the final exams.

This behavior goes unnoticed or it is only estimated in the traditional web usage mining, where it is supposed that the user opens only one page at a time. However, if we could record the parallel browsing behavior, we could better understand the user's activity, goals and improve learner model employed for personalization. The paths through resources (including spawning new tabs and switching between them) of many learners also express relevance between these resources and this can be leveraged in applications such as recommendation to other learners browsing similar learning objects.

In this paper, we examine how students’ high school track placements affect teacher expectations regarding students’ educational attainment in the NELS data. NELS is a large, nationally representative longitudinal study from the United States of the graduating class of 1992. We focus on students with discrepant track placements to determine how different teachers evaluate the same student. Overall, for the same student, teachers in high track classes have higher college expectations than teachers in lower track classrooms.","Tracking, Teacher expectations, Social categorization, Within-student models",""

Indeed, cultures are known to strongly impact how people interpret their surrounding environment, hence generating cognitive and affective biases that could impact computer-supported educational activities. Consequently, educational technologies trying to become culturally-aware need to develop a socio-cultural model of their learner. In this regard, many previous projects have used a fixed set of socio-cultural criteria.

One stream of research on learning performance visualization attempts to build a visual presentation of students' learning progress, targeting the needs of instructors and academic advisors. The other stream of research on Open Student Modeling (OSM) attempts to visualize the state of individual student's knowledge and present the visualization directly to the student. The results of the studies in that area show that, presenting students with basic representation of their knowledge will result in facilitating their metacognitive activities and promoting self-reflection and awareness. This paper tries to study the impact of a more sophisticated form of performance visualization on students. We believe that our visualization tool can positively influence students by granting them the opportunity to get a view of their performance in the content of the class progress. Moreover, we tried to boost their motivation by building a positive sense of competition using a representation of average class performance. In this paper we present study comparing two groups of students, one using the visualization and another without visualization. The results of the study shows that: 1) the students are likely to use the social visualization tool during the whole semester to monitor their progress in comparison with their peers; 2) the visualization tool encourages students to use the learning materials in a more continuous manner during the whole semester and 3) students will achieve a higher success rate in answering self-assessment quizzes.","",""

The ANFIS model was designed using trial and error based on various experiments. This study was conducted to illustrate that ANFIS is effective with hybrid learning, for the adaptation of learning content according to learners' needs. Study results show that ANFIS has been successfully implemented for learning content adaptation within different learning context scenarios. The performance of the ANFIS model was evaluated using standard error measurements which revealed the optimal setting necessary for better predictability. The MATLAB simulation results indicate that the performance of the ANFIS approach is valuable and easy to implement. The study results are based on analysis of different model settings; they confirm that the m-learning application is functional. However, it should be noted that an increase in the number of inputs being considered by the model will increase the system response time, and hence the delay for the mobile learner.","Computing and Processing, Adaptation models, Mobile communication, Context, Cognition, Adaptive systems, Machine learning, Learning systems, ANFIS, adaptation, Mobile learning, learner modeling",""

The aim is to enhance the learning of students by the self-adaptation of a Web-based educational system (WBES). The adaptive system’s behavior is achieved as a result of the decisions made by a student model (SM). The decision reveals the lecture option most suitable to teach a concept according to the student’s profile. Thus, the lecture content is authored from different view points (e.g. learning theory, type of media, complexity level, and user-system interaction degree). The purpose is to tailor several educational options to teach a given concept. Thereby, the SM elicits psychological attributes of the student to describe subjective traits, such as: cognitive, personality, and learning preferences. It also depicts pedagogical properties of the available lecture’s options. Moreover, the SM dynamically builds a cognitive map (CM) to set fuzzy-causal relationships among the lecture’s option properties )","FUZZY logic, PREDICTION models, ADAPTIVE control systems, PSYCHOLOGY of learning, COGNITIVE maps (Psychology), STUDENTS, ONLINE education, DECISION making, BRAIN-computer interfaces, Causal relationship, Cognitive map, Fuzzy-causal inference, Student model, Web-based educational system",""

As such, these studies aimed to propose and compare two conceptual change Bayesian network models; with the first model constructed based on the classical conceptual change theory, while another with the addition of affective factors in the model.

First, what constitute the appropriate variables for modeling scientific inquiry skills in such a learning environment, considering the fact that it practices exploratory learning approach? Following exploratory learning approach, students are granted the freedom to navigate from one GUI to another. Second, do causal dependencies exist between the identified variables, and if they do, how should they be defined? To tackle the challenges, this research work attempted the Bayesian Networks framework. Leveraging on the framework, two student models were constructed to predict the acquisition of scientific inquiry skills for INQPRO, a scientific inquiry learning environment developed in this research work. The student models can be differentiated by the variables they modeled and the causal dependencies they encoded. An on-field evaluation involving 101 students was performed to assess the most appropriate structure of the INQPRO’s student model. To ensure fairness in model comparison, the same Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) construction approach was employed.

It is traditionally taught in finance and accounting classes for use in various applications in the business curriculum. These concepts are also very useful in real life situations such as calculating the amount to save for retirement. This paper details a retirement model that can be built during class to teach TVM. While traditional teaching methods give small pieces of the TVM picture, then exercises to reinforce that partial knowledge, this model incorporates many TVM techniques into one Excel modeling exercise. The model incorporates both TVM functions that are included in Excel and other formulas that must be entered into Excel by the student modeler. Unlike some other articles that focus on how much should be saved annually assuming a constant salary, this exercise focuses on a percentage of income to be saved. The model also addresses an assumed growth factor in the salary and the issue of inflation. This modeling tool is presented to adults in graduate level classes, so it incorporates the fact that they might already have some savings coming into this retirement planning exercise. This method of teaching TVM has several objectives. Primarily, the exercise contributes to the learning of TVM concepts and techniques. It also shows how the equations modeled here can be used to solve retirement planning questions, while contributing to the personal financial literacy of students, and improving model building skills in Excel.","Retirement; Preretirement Education; Money Management; Courseware; Computer Software; Teaching Methods; Models; Learning Activities; Concept Teaching; Business Administration Education; Case Method (Teaching Technique); College Programs; Time Perspective; Educational Practices; Educational Strategies",""

The MLFF was adopted because of its ability on imprecise or incompletely understood data, ability to generalize and learn from specific examples, ability to be quickly updated with extra parameters, and speed in execution making them ideal for real time applications. The system then adaptively recommended learning content presented with a variety of content and interactive components through the adaptation model based on the student cognitive style identified in the student model. The adaptive web interfaces were designed by investigating the relationships between students’ cognitive styles and browsing patterns of content and interactive components. Training of the MLFF and an experiment were conducted to examine the accuracy of identifying students’ cognitive styles during browsing with the proposed MLFF and the impact of the proposed adaptive web-based system on students’ engagement in learning. The training results of the MLFF showed that the proposed system could identify students’ cognitive styles with high accuracy and the temporal effects should be considered while identifying students’ cognitive styles during browsing. Two factors, the acknowledgment of students’ cognitive styles while browsing and the existence of adaptive web interfaces, were used to assign three classes of college freshmen into three groups. The experimental results revealed that the proposed system could have significant impacts on temporal effects on students’ engagement in learning, not only for students with cognitive styles known before browsing, but also for students with cognitive styles identified during browsing. The results provide evidence of the effectiveness of the adaptive web-based learning system with students’ cognitive styles dynamically identified during browsing, thus validating the research purposes of this study.","Distance education and telelearning, Human–computer interface, Intelligent tutoring systems, Multimedia/hypermedia systems",""

We investigated the spelling behavior of children by means of learning curves based on log-file data of the previous and the enhanced software version. First, we compared the learning progress of children with dyslexia working either with the previous software (n = 28) or the adapted version (n = 37). Second, we investigated the spelling behavior of children with dyslexia (n = 37) and matched children without dyslexia (n = 25). To gain deeper insight into which factors are relevant for acquiring spelling skills, we analyzed the influence of cognitive abilities, such as attention functions and verbal memory skills, on the learning behavior. All investigations of the learning process are based on learning curve analyses of the collected log-file data. The results evidenced that those children with dyslexia benefit significantly from the additional phonological cue and the corresponding phoneme-based student model. Actually, children with dyslexia improve their spelling skills to the same extent as children without dyslexia and were able to memorize phoneme to grapheme correspondence when given the correct support and adequate training. In addition, children with low attention functions benefit from the structured learning environment. Generally, our data showed that memory sources are supportive cognitive functions for acquiring spelling skills and for using the information cues of a multi-modal learning environment.","Reading*, Software*, Acoustic Stimulation/*methods, Dyslexia/*physiopathology, Learning/*physiology, Photic Stimulation/*methods, Child, Dyslexia/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Psychomotor Performance/physiology",""

In an e-Learning system, one size does not fit all. Therefore, it is a challenge to make e-Learning systems that are suitably “adaptive”. The aim of adaptive e-Learning is to provide the students the appropriate content at the right time, means that the system is able to determine the knowledge level, keep track of usage, and arrange content automatically for each student for the best learning result. This study presents a proposed system which includes major adaptive features based on a student model. The proposed system is able to initialize the student model for determining the knowledge level of a student when the student registers for the course. After a student starts learning the lessons and doing many activities, the system can track information of the student until he/she takes a test. The student’s knowledge level, based on the test scores, is updated into the system for use in the adaptation process, which combines the student model with the domain model in order to deliver suitable course contents to the students. In this study, the proposed adaptive e-Learning system is implemented on an “Introduction to Java Programming Language” course, using LearnSquare software. After the system was tested, the results showed positive feedback towards the proposed system, especially in its adaptive capability.","e-Learning, Adaptive, Adaptation Process, Adaptation Techniques Student Model, Domain Model, General Works",""

The objective of this paper is to explore the creation of successful e-learning systems that are able to increase users’ learning performance and enhance their personal learning experiences. The paper reports two converging and complimentary approaches, namely case studies and experimentation. First, case studies are used to explore the extent to which effective e-learning systems comply with eight specific factors. Of the eight, accessibility, individual differences and student modeling turn out to be the weakest points in current practice. Second, an empirical study investigates the influences of user individual user differences on users’ learning outcomes in an e-learning environment. The experiment found that individual differences in motivation to learn and expectations about e-learning significantly impacted users’ learning achievements. Third, based on these studies, improvements in research methodology are identified towards greater consideration of user sensitive research issues, thus enabling us to outline improved experimental procedures. Further experiment results should provide us with better insights into the arguments needed to carefully assess benefits of developing and involving a user model in an e-learning application. Consequently, evaluation and justification could now encompass both system performance as well as user performance.","User sensitive research, User individual characteristics, User modelling, Intelligent user interfaces, e-learning systems",""

The goal of developing AEHS is to achieve an effective and affective learning performance, as well as to get positive impacts on the student through gaining skills and learning experiences. Most AEHS are technologically-driven to transfer knowledge rather than pedagogically-driven focusing on gaining cognitive skills and other experiences. To overcome this gap many researchers considered Cognitive style (CS) as the most important factor for reasoning and predicting individual traits, learning strategies and other preferences. Furthermore many researchers proposed new cognitive factors- rational, intuitive, and interpersonal as the most innate, brain-based, fixed stable preferences to build a robust adaptive student model dynamically and to get positive influence on the affective and effective AEHS. Based on the literature review, we have identified a number of theoretical and technical issues related to the AEHS architecture in relation to the whole brain cognitive style model to achieve an effective learning outcomes. The findings will be used for designing a user model for AEHS.","",""

Ubiquitous learning as one application of ubiquitous computing is playing a very important role in our daily life. Training is a kind of learning in ubiquitous environment. During the whole training process, the performance of a learner in a series of units may change with patterns: progress, plateau, and decline. Therefore, it is necessary to apply different support strategies to adapt to different states of the learner. In the previous work, a mutual adaptive support based on one learner model was proposed. However one learner model may sometime make the learner lose his/her motivation easily, since each learner does the training independently. There is a need to propose support for group training which is used to let learners do training and improve themselves together. But in the current models for group training, most of them focus on cooperative and competitive training but ignore balance feeling of connection and burden of learners. Feeling of connection is very important in group training since it can give learners continuing motivation by exchanging information. However it also may bring burden to learners due to frequency, volume and content of exchanged information. So an effective mechanism is needed to balance the feeling of burden and connection of multiple learners. To this end, we propose a new support method for a pair of learners to solve the problem. In this paper, firstly, we calculate how much a learner affects the other learner. Then we design an algorithm to judge the feeling of connection and burden from the other leaner. Finally, due to different feeling of connection and burden, various support strategies are designed to support learners. We have implemented our support method in a typing game and shown the method can balance the feeling of connection and burden.","",""

It is widely adopted in teaching students with disabilities. The adaptive teaching pedagogy exploits interactions between learners and educator and is one of the best strategies to meet the different learning styles of individual student. The adaptive teaching creates a teaching and learning environment that improves the learning efficiency. This paper presents an online adaptive tutoring system (ATS) that is aimed at alleviating some of the problems that are faced by large class teaching. The ATS represents a knowledge domain as a concept structure and models the student with Bayesian networks. Based on the Bayesian student model, the tutoring system provides individualized tutoring and instant feedback to each student. The system has been applied in teaching digital circuit design in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of National University of Singapore. The survey conducted indicates the effectiveness of the proposed ATS-based teaching strategy.","",""

Therefore, a student model considering individual characteristics in groups is introduced in this article. This model is built by automatically analysing collaborative behaviour and capturing the context in which it appears. A particular contribution of this approach is focused on a flexible structure of collaboration contexts which are defined at runtime.

However, ensuring that learning has taken place is the ultimate challenge. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have been incorporated into game-based learning environments to guide learners’ exploration. Emotions have proven to be deeply intertwined with cognitive and motivational factors. ITSs attempt to recognise and convey emotion in order to enhance students’ learning and engagement. The ITS student model is responsible for attainment of adaptability and understanding of learners’ needs. It is not clear which emotions are relevant to the teaching-learning experience, or what antecedents and interpersonal differences are involved in determining an emotion. Therefore, student modelling involves uncertainty. Creating an emotional student model that can reason about students’ observable behaviour during online game-play is the main goal of our research. The analysis, design and implementation for this model are our central focus here. The model uses as a basis the Control-Value theory of achievement emotions and employs motivational and cognitive variables to determine an emotion.

Results from a prototyping exercise conducted along with the outcome-prospective emotions DBN are presented and discussed.

However, there is not a lot of practical guidance on how to construct and train such models. This paper compares two approaches for student modeling, Knowledge Tracing (KT) and Performance Factors Analysis (PFA), by evaluating their predictive accuracy on individual student practice opportunities. We explore the space of design decisions for each approach and find a set of ""best practices"" for each. In a head to head comparison, we find that PFA has considerably higher predictive accuracy than KT. In addition to being more accurate, we found that PFA's parameter estimates were more plausible. Our best-performing model was a variant of PFA that ignored the tutor's transfer model; that is, it assumed all skills influenced performance on all problems. One possible implication is that this result is a general one suggesting there is benefit from considering models that incorporate information from more than the typical handful of skills associated with a problem in the transfer model. Alternately, an explanation for this result is the transfer model that our tutor uses is particularly weak. We also found that both KT and PFA have relatively low predictive accuracy for cases where students generate incorrect responses, and 2/3 of the model's errors are false positives, indicating a better means of determining when students will make mistakes is needed.

RCTs have been used in the intelligent tutoring community for decades to determine which questions and tutorial feedback work best. Practically speaking, however, ITS creators need to make decisions on what content to deploy without the luxury of running an RCT. Additionally, most log data produced by an ITS is not in a form that can be evaluated for learning effectiveness with traditional methods. As a result, there is much data produced by tutoring systems that we as education researchers would like to be learning from but are not. In prior work we introduced one approach to this problem: a Bayesian knowledge tracing derived method that could analyze the log data of a tutoring system to determine which items were most effective for learning among a set of items of the same skill. The method was validated by way of simulations. In the current work we further evaluate this method and introduce a second, learning gain, analysis method for comparison. These methods were applied to 11 experiment datasets that investigated the effectiveness of various forms of tutorial help in a web-based math tutoring system. We found that the tutorial help chosen by the Bayesian method as having the highest rate of learning agreed with the learning gain analysis in 10 out of 11 of the experiments. An additional simulation study is presented comparing the statistical power of each method given different sample sizes.

In this paper, we present a machine-learned model that assesses the probability that a student learned a KC at a specific problem step (instead of at the next or previous problem step). We use this model to analyze which KCs are learned gradually, and which are learned in 'eureka' moments. We also discuss potential ways that this model could be used to improve the effectiveness of cognitive mastery learning.

The effects of model expertise (i.e., worked example based on advanced, third-year student model or expert physiotherapist model) in relation to students' expertise (i.e., first- or second-year) were investigated.; Sample: One hundred and thirty-four physiotherapy students (61 first-year and 73 second-year).; Methods: Design was 2 × 2 factorial with factors 'Student Expertise' (first-year vs. second-year) and 'Model Expertise' (expert vs. advanced student). Within expertise levels, students were randomly assigned to the Expert Example or the Advanced Student Example condition. All students studied two examples (content depending on their assigned condition) and then completed a retention and test task. They rated their invested mental effort after each example and test task.; Results: Second-year students invested less mental effort in studying the examples, and in performing the retention and transfer tasks than first-year students. They also performed better on the retention test, but not on the transfer test. In contrast to our hypothesis, there was no interaction between student expertise and model expertise: all students who had studied the Expert examples performed better on the transfer test than students who had studied Advanced Student Examples.; Conclusions: This study suggests that when worked examples are based on actual performance, rather than an ideal procedure, expert models are to be preferred over advanced student models.","Faculty*, Peer Group*, Professional Competence*, Medical History Taking/*methods, Physical Therapy Specialty/*education, Teaching/*methods, Achievement, Adolescent, Curriculum, Female, Humans, Male, Mobility Limitation, Netherlands, Retention, Psychology, Stroke Rehabilitation, Transfer, Psychology, Young Adult",""

SOCIALX is a web-based system that supports social and cooperative aspects of e-learning, embedded in a reputation system. It provides social exchange through sharing and reuse of solutions to exercises, micro-forum discussions on exercises, and development of projects through “socio-collaborative group work”. The proposed model designs a two-way communication between LECOMPS and SOCIALX, in such a way that (1) the student model, managed by the former system, can be used to determine which subset of the exercises is presently more suitable for the individual learner, and can therefore be proposed in the latter system; (2) the solution of exercises, and the associated learner's reputation gained in SOCIALX, can be used to update the student model maintained by LECOMPS. This two-way transfer of model parameters and structures, addresses the main issues, namely collaborative learning and support to proximal development, which make up the core of Vygotskij's educational theory.","",""

However, typical Wikis do not adequately address the assessment of individual student contributions toward their groups or provide any automated group formation mechanism. To improve these aspects, we have designed and implemented ClassroomWiki - a web-based collaborative Wiki writing tool. For the students, ClassroomWiki provides a web interface for writing and revising their group's Wiki and a topic-based forum for discussing their ideas during collaboration. When the students collaborate, ClassroomWiki tracks all student activities and builds detailed student models that represent their contributions toward their groups. For the teacher, ClassroomWiki provides a multiagent framework that uses the student models to form student groups to improve the collaborative learning of students. To investigate the impact of ClassroomWiki, we have conducted a three-week-long collaborative Wiki writing assignment in a university-level history course. The results suggest that ClassroomWiki can 1) improve the collaborative learning outcome of the students by its group formation framework, 2) help the teacher better assess a student's contribution toward his or her group and avoid free riding, and 3) facilitate specific and precise teacher intervention with accurate and detailed tracking of student activities.","Computing and Processing, Collaboration, Collaborative work, Writing, Data mining, Student members, Student activities, History, multiagent systems., Collaborative learning tool",""

Computer technology has long been used to try to overcome the challenges of distance learning although with limited success. To improve this situation, the authors developed a theoretical framework for second language learning that combined a cognitive student model with a collaborative group model. As the underlying access to information and computational resources becomes more ubiquitous, the framework is less able to represent how a specific computing device and real-world context mediate the selection and structuring of materials and activities, therefore, limiting the framework's effectiveness for second language learning. Hence, the existing models need to be complemented with a functional ubiquity model, which characterises the way in which the degree of ubiquity defines the types of learning activities and resources available in the framework.","Company business management, Technology application, Computer supported collaborative learning -- Models, Distance education -- Management, Distance education -- Models, Distance education -- Technology application, Education, United States",""

The model of the student in our system is inferred using a higher level LA, referred to as a meta-LA , which attempts to characterize the learning model of the students (or student simulators), while the latter use the tutorial- like system. The meta-LA , in turn, uses LAs as a learning mechanism to try to determine if the student in question is a fast, normal, or slow learner. The ultimate long-term goal of the exercise is the following: if the tutorial- like system can understand how the student perceives and processes knowledge, it will be able to customize the way by which it communicates the knowledge to the student to attain an optimal teaching strategy. The proposed meta-LA scheme has been tested for numerous environments, including the established benchmarks, and the results obtained are remarkable. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first published result that infers the learning model of an LA when it is externally treated as a black box, whose outputs are the only observable quantities.

The challenges could be more complicated when such learning environment employs exploratory learning approach. One plausible approach to tackle the challenges is by employing data mining approach. In this study, 129 interaction logs were firstly preprocessed and subsequently transformed into structured dataset fits for mining purpose. Feature selection algorithms were performed considering that fact the dataset consists of large number of attributes. The dimension of feature set was reduced via two feature selection algorithms and elicitation of domain expert, resulting in M_ORA, M_RFE, and M_DOM, respectively. The feature sets were compared using Naïve Bayesian Networks (M_NB_DOM, M_NB_RFE, M_NB_ORA). The second phase of empirical study aimed to investigated the optimal BN model for capturing knowledge about conceptual change. To do that, a machine-learned Bayesian Network (M_LBN) was constructed and its performance was compared to M_NB_DOM. Findings from empirical studies suggested that (i) classifiers constructed using M_DOM outperformed M_ORA and M_RFE and (ii) the classifier M_LBN outperformed M_NB_DOM in predicting conceptual change, suggesting that M_LBN is a better classifier than M_NB_DOM in capturing knowledge about conceptual change in INQPRO, a scientific inquiry learning environment developed in this research work.","",""

Negotiable student models take this a step further, and allow students to negotiate and potentially modify their model. Very few negotiable student models have been implemented, and only in relatively simple systems, not integrated into a complex Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). Therefore, it is not clearly known whether negotiable student models pose a significant advantage over simpler open student models. This research implements a basic negotiable student model into a version of a complex and internationally deployed ITS. Subjective evaluation is performed, and shows promising results. Participants felt the negotiable student model was both useful for learning, and enjoyable to use. With a few improvements, this negotiable student model implementation could be used in a wide-scale objective analysis to help determine the usefulness of negotiable student models.

In traditional classrooms, the human teacher utilizes his experience and intelligence to adapt the teaching method and style to meet the average student in the classroom. This research has focused on improving the effectiveness and quality of web-based e-learning through adapting the course authoring and delivery to match each individual student skills and preferences. In this article, we shed lights on the vision and status of the eight-year Smart e-Learning environment project: The main objective of this project is to employ AI techniques to advance e-learning forward towards the fifth generation e-learning as we envision it. The idea is to embed instructional design theories as well as learning and cognition theories into e-learning environments to provide a more intelligent and, hence, more effective one-to-one e-learning environments.

In this paper, we give a mathematically rigorous treatment of the problem in the framework of Bayesian decision theory. To quantify the opportunities for learning, we assume that the learning tasks that yield the most information about the current skills of the student, while being desirable for measurement in their own right, would also be among those that are efficient for learning. Indeed, optimization of the expected information gain appears to naturally avoid tasks that are exceedingly demanding or exceedingly easy as their results are predictable and thus uninformative. Still, tasks that are efficient for learning may be experienced as too challenging, and the resulting failures can lower motivation. Therefore, in addition to quantifying the expected informational benefit for learning of any prospective task to be presented next, we also model the expected motivational cost of its presentation, measured simply as the estimated probability of failure in our example model. We propose a “learner-friendly” adaptation algorithm that chooses the learning tasks by optimizing the expected benefit divided by the expected cost. We apply this algorithm to a Rasch-like student model implemented within a real-world application and present initial results of a pilot experiment.","Bayesian adaptive estimation, Bayesian decision theory, Mutual information, Item response theory, Real-time assessment, Adaptive learning game, Educational game, E-learning, Hidden Markov Model, Dynamic Bayesian network, Fast Fourier Transform",""

Being local, the material used by the educational institution for instruction quickly becomes stagnated. Further, the institution tends to overlook quality materials that are available elsewhere. In addressing these key shortcomings, GLMS a) recognizes course content in terms of its geographically distributed units (aka, learning objects), b) associates cross-institutional instructional processes to learning objects, and c) ensures security, privacy, and authenticity for the use of learning objects. We borrow established techniques from Grid Computing to achieve these three goals. Other benefits that we anticipate from GLMS include distributed resource sharing, heterogeneous learning objects for adaptive learning, scalability of learning objects, discovery of resources, learner modeling and security management.

To deal with this problem, this work focuses on the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) approach in determining the possible conditions in order to form a fuzzy rule based system of a student model. The back- propagation is utilized as the learning mechanism for the neural network to solve the incompleteness in the decision made by human experts.

This research aims to test the hypothesis that, through adding features of serious games to VLs and integrating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, an enhancement of student motivation, knowledge and understanding can be attained. This work introduces the Olympia architecture, which is based on a previous architecture that combines VLs and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). In addition, Olympia enables the combination of serious games with ITSs, resulting in an educational game virtual laboratory (GVL). The GVL provides affective feedback through sound, a more engaging look-and-feel and defines student actions through the game mechanics module. Olympia was tested in a case study on teaching linear momentum in an undergraduate Physics course. For the first evaluation, a VL and a GVL were implemented. The results showed that students were motivated and learned in a similar way with both the GVL and VL environments. Later, several additions were integrated in both environments: the probabilistic student model was improved, tutorial videos were added, and the feedback was refined. For the second evaluation the results suggest that using the GVL resulted in higher learning gains than using VL.","",""

A dynamical accompaniment of students, during the course, allows one to consider these aspects and consequently adapts the content presentation to learning style, behavior, rhythm and knowledge of each student. This problem has been divided in two parts. The first one is the content sequencing, that has been successfully accomplished by AI techniques, specially AI Planning. The second one is the adaptation of content sequence presentation to the student profile that needs a student model. So, in order to cope with this problem, this work presents an approach based on AI Planning techniques and Workflow for generating content sequences. The Workflow technology has great similarities with Planning and allows the management of student activities. The student model considers the learning style, profile and preferences of each student and in this way it is possible to adapt the content sequence presentation to the student.","",""

Using NBTree classification algorithm in conjunction with Binary Relevance classifier, the learners are classified based on their interests. Then, learners' learning styles are detected using these classification results.

Three factors have been identified to influence the matching accuracy of INQPRO's learner model. These factors are the structure of DDN model, the variable instantiation approach, and the weights assignment method for two consecutive Decision Networks (DNs). In this research work, a two-phase empirical study involving 107 learners and six domain experts was conducted to determine the optimal conditions for the INQPRO's dynamic learner model. The empirical results suggested each time-slice of the INQPRO's DDN should consist of a DN, and that DN should correspond to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) accessed. In light of evidence, observable variables should be instantiated to their observed states; leaving the remaining observable nodes uninstantiated. The empirical results also indicated that varying weights between two consecutive DNs could optimize the matching accuracy of INQPRO's dynamic learner model.

The advantages stemmed from the design and the use of ontologies are quite valuable, such as: the formal representation of knowledge based on axioms; the inferences outcome from inheritance relations; the easy-readable ontology’s code for humans and machines; and the provision of federative services for ontology management through agents. Hence, as a result of the experiment that was fulfilled in a Web based education system (WBES), I found out that ontologies provide a solid and reliability support for depicting attributes that concern to an individual, who is represented by a student model (SM).","",""

ITS needs the construction of complex models to represent the skills that students are using and their knowledge states, and practitioners want cognitively diagnostic information at a finer grained level. Traditionally, most assessments treat all questions on the test as sampling a single underlying knowledge component. Can we have our cake and eat it, too? That is, can we have a good overall prediction of a high stakes test, while at the same time be able to tell teachers meaningful information about fine-grained knowledge components? In this paper, we introduce an online intelligent tutoring system that has been widely used. We then present some encouraging results about a fine-grained skill model with the system that is able to predict state test scores. This model allows the system track about 106 knowledge components for eighth grade math. In total, 921 eighth grade students were involved in the study. We show that our fine-grained model could improve prediction compared to other coarser grained models and an IRT-based model. We conclude that this intelligent tutoring system can be a good predictor of performance.","Computing and Processing, Artificial intelligence, Data mining, Analytical models, Probability density function, Computational modeling, Education, Standards, mixed-effects model., Intelligent tutoring systems, cognitive diagnostic assessment, fine-grained skill model, statistical analysis of skill models",""

It involves different and sometimes uncorrelated sub-tasks: building a student model to define her needs, defining tools and procedures to perform tests, understanding students' replies to system prompts, defining suitable procedures to evaluate the correctness of students' replies, and strategies to improve students' abilities after the assessment session.In this work we present an improvement of our system, TutorJ, with particular attention to the assessment phase. Many tutoring systems offer only a limited set of assessment options like multiple-choice questions,fill-in-the-blanks tests or other types of predefined replies obtained through graphical widgets (radio-buttons, text-areas). This limited set of solutions makes interaction poor and unable to satisfy the users' needs. Our interest is to enrich interaction with dialog in natural language. In this respect, the assessment problem is strictly connected to natural language understanding. The preliminary step is indeed to understand questions and replies of the student.We have reviewed the system design in the framework of a cognitive architecture with the aim to reach a double result: the reduction of the effort for the construction of the knowledge base and the improvement of the system capabilities in the assessment process.

It is often considered as a collaboration between students and the system to promote learners’ reflection and to collaboratively assess the course. When adaptive learning environments are used in the classroom, teachers act as a guide through the learning process. Thus, they need to monitor students’ interactions in order to understand and evaluate their activities. Although, the knowledge gained through this monitorization can be extremely useful to student modeling, collaboration between teachers and the system to achieve this goal has not been considered in the literature. In this paper we present a framework to support teachers in this task. In order to prove the usefulness of this framework we have implemented and evaluated it in an adaptive web-based educational system called PDinamet.

Adaptivity plays an important role in ubiquitous learning, aiming at providing students with adaptive and personalized learning material, activities, and information at the right place and the right time. However, for providing rich adaptivity, the student model needs to be able to gather a variety of information about the students. In this paper, an automatic, global, and dynamic student modeling approach is introduced, which aims at identifying and frequently updating information about students’ progress, learning styles, interests and knowledge level, problem solving abilities, preferences for using the system, social connectivity, and current location. This information is gathered in an automatic way, using students’ behavior and actions in different learning situations provided by different components/services of the ubiquitous learning environment. By providing a comprehensive student model, students can be supported by rich adaptivity in every component/service of the learning environment. Furthermore, the information in the student model can help in giving teachers a better understanding about the students’ learning process.","Student modeling, ubiquitous learning, adaptivity, General Works",""

Exploring how to optimally develop this skill is therefore of paramount importance to education researchers. This is certainly no less true in health care, where optimal patient care is contingent on the continuous efforts of doctors and other health care workers to provide the best care to their patients through the development and incorporation of new knowledge. Medical education programmes must therefore foster the skills and attitudes necessary to engage future doctors in the systematic development of innovative problem solving. The aim of this paper is to describe the perceptions and experiences of medical students in their third and fourth years of training, and to explore their understanding of their development as adaptive experts.; Methods: A sample of 25 medical students participated in individual 45-60-minute semi-structured interviews. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and entered into NVivo qualitative data analysis software to facilitate a thematic analysis. The analysis was both inductive, in that themes were generated from the data, and deductive, in that our data were meaningful when interpreted in the context of theories of adaptive expertise.; Results: Participants expressed a general belief that, as learners in the health care system, exerting any effort to be innovative was beyond the scope of their responsibilities. Generally, students suggested that innovative practice was the prerogative of experts and an outcome of expert development centred on the acquisition of knowledge and experience.; Conclusions: Students' perceptions of themselves as having no responsibility to be innovative in their learning process have implications for their learning trajectories as adaptive experts.","Attitude of Health Personnel*, Clinical Clerkship*, Diffusion of Innovation*, Clinical Competence/*standards, Education, Medical/*standards, Adaptation, Psychological, Expert Testimony, Humans, Research",""

The goal of the system is twofold: first, to initialize the student model when a new student logs on the tutor system and second, to update the student model depending on the studentpsilas interaction with the system and exchanging this information with its peers. The quality of the system is evaluated in terms of its ability for searching similar cases (accuracy) tested under three different strategies.

The approach was developed for learning management systems, which are commonly used in e-learning. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, a study with 127 students was performed, comparing the results of the automatic approach with those of a learning style questionnaire. The evaluation yielded good results and demonstrated that the proposed approach is suitable for identifying learning styles. By using the proposed approach, studentspsila learning styles can be identified automatically and be used for supporting students by considering their individual learning styles.","",""

This approach utilizes a hybrid algorithm based on Fuzzy-ART2 neural network and stochastic method called Hidden Markov Model (HMM), in order to evaluate and categorize students' knowledge status in six levels: Excellent, very good, good, fair, weak and very weak; depending on 5 parameters collected through their interactions with the system. The student model is initialized by presenting a pre-test form to students and it is updated dynamically according to their study times and assessment results. Students' knowledge status are modeled through three phases, initialization, training and recall phases. In the initialization phase, input vectors are normalized before they are categorized using unsupervised algorithm Fuzzy-ART2 in 6 clusters representing 6 knowledge status. A HMM is created for each cluster and when new students' parameters are collected, they are introduced to Baum- Welch re-estimation algorithm to train the 6 HMMs and to maximize the observed sequence that is associated with a particular cluster. Forward algorithm evaluates then the likelihood of this sequence with respect to each of the HMMs and to determine the maximum value, which represents the actual knowledge status of the student. Experiment results show that the proposed approach is capable of categorizing student parameter vectors to their corresponding cluster with good accuracies.

Therefore, mechanisms are needed to support the detection process of the required information. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between learning styles, in particular, those pertaining to the Felder–Silverman learning style model and working memory capacity, one of the cognitive traits included in the cognitive trait model. The identified relationship is derived from links between learning styles, cognitive styles, and working memory capacity which are based on studies from the literature.

Because self-efficacious students are effective learners, endowing intelligent tutoring systems with the ability to diagnose self-efficacy could lead to improved pedagogy. Self-efficacy is influenced by (and influences) affective state. Thus, physiological data might be used to predict a student’s level of self-efficacy. This article investigates an inductive approach to automatically constructing models of self-efficacy that can be used at runtime to inform pedagogical decisions. It reports on two complementary empirical studies. In the first study, two families of self-efficacy models were induced: a static self-efficacy model, learned solely from pre-test (non-intrusively collected) data, and a dynamic self-efficacy model, learned from both pre-test data as well as runtime physiological data collected with a biofeedback apparatus. In the second empirical study, a similar experimental design was applied to an interactive narrative-centered learning environment. Self-efficacy models were induced from combinations of static and dynamic information, including pre-test data, physiological data, and observations of student behavior in the learning environment. The highest performing induced naïve Bayes models correctly classified 85.2% of instances in the first empirical study and 82.1% of instances in the second empirical study.

For example, the short message and browsing functions in a cell phone provide users with timely and adaptive information access. Although many studies of mobile learning indicate the pedagogical potential of mobile devices, the screen size, computational power, battery capacity, input interfaces, and network bandwidth are too restricted to develop acceptable functionality for the entire learning processes in a handheld device. Therefore, mobile devices can be adopted to fill the gap between Web-based learning and ubiquitous mobile learning. This study first creates a website, providing functions enabling learning to take place anytime and anywhere with any available learning device, for ubiquitous learning according to various properties of mobile devices. Nowadays, learners' behaviors on a website can be recorded as learning portfolios and analyzed for behavioral diagnosis or instructional planning. A student model is then built according to the analytical results of learning portfolios and a concept map of the learning domain. Based on the student model and learners' available learning devices, three modules are developed to build a ubiquitous learning environment to enhance learning performance via learning status awareness, schedule reminders and mentor recommendation. Finally, an experiment is conducted with 54 college students after implementation of the ubiquitous learning website. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system can enhance three learning performance indicators, namely academic performance, task accomplishment rates, and learning goals achievement rates.

The standards are more and more relevant for this effect, allowing systems communicate and to share data, components and structures, at syntax and semantic level, even if most of them still only allow syntax integration.","Adpative Hypermedia System, E-learning, User Model, User modeling, Multimedia materials, Architectural models, Stereotypes, Learning styles, Learning, Cognitive models, Electronic learning, Constructivism, Modeling",""

Self-efficacy judgments are based on four sources of information: an individual's own past performance, vicarious experiences of observing the performances of others, verbal persuasion that one possesses certain capabilities, and physiological states. Individuals use these four sources of information to judge their capability to complete future tasks. Teachers who capitalize on the influence of the strongest of these sources--past performances, observations of others as models, and verbal persuasion--produce more confident students. The following instructional strategies increase student self-efficacy: (1) Reviewing lesson accomplishments from the previous day, posting the current lesson's objectives prior to instruction, drawing attention to the lesson objectives as they are covered, and reviewing the lesson objectives at the end of the lesson; (2) Asking students to record each day on a calendar something new they learned that day or something at which they excelled; (3) Prompting students who perform poorly to attribute their failures to lack of effort and encouraging them to try harder; (4) Drawing students' attention to their growth and complimenting them on their specific skills; and (5) Using student models early to demonstrate some aspects of a lesson to remind them that other students like themselves are mastering the material and therefore they can master it also. Teachers who use these strategies on a daily basis produce students who are more confident in their academic skills.

In a number of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), such as ActiveMath, tests are assembled by the system from a pool of questions using student and domain models that are manipulated with automated reasoning machines such as Elvira or Jess. It may be argued that such forms of evaluation are adaptive in a per- question basis. Other, more commercial products such as on-line book resorce of Physics by Wilson Buffa (Prentice- Hall), and the Brownstone software don't offer selective assembly of quizzes and tests, resorting rather to large exam sets from which the user may encounter a variety of practice options. In the case of courses un mathematics and physics, it would be desirable to have the questions themselves be adaptive, that is, that the values and variables used in formulas within the exam be adaptive based on student and domain models. This way, the size of question databases would be greatly reduced as these become databases with learning objects themselves. We have produced the first prototype of such a system.

The intelligence of a learning environment is largely attributed to its ability of adapting to a specific learner during the learning process. The adaptation depends on individual learner's knowledge of the subject to be learned, and other relevant characteristics of the learner. The knowledge and the relevant information about the learner are maintained in the learner model. A learner model can be defined as structured information about the learning process; and this structure contains some values of the learner's characteristics. This paper proposes a new learner model, which is based on the consideration of what is appropriate to the learning-by-example context. The model records five categories of information about the learner: personal data, learner's characteristics, learning state, learner's interactions with the system, and learner's knowledge. This model is being integrated in Sphinx, an educational environment based on learning by means of examples.","",""

The lack of a framework to discuss open learner models poses several difficulties: there is no systematic way to analyse and describe the open learner models of any one system; there is no systematic way to compare the features of open learner models in different systems; and the designers of each new adaptive learning system must repeatedly tread the same path of studying the many diverse uses and approaches of open learner modelling so that they might determine how to make use of open learner modelling in their system.

Over an eight-year period, a relatively stable group of 55 secondary teachers engaged in ongoing professional development implemented a cognitive strategies approach to reading and writing instruction, making visible for approximately 2000 students per year the thinking tools experienced readers and writers access in the process of meaning construction. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of this approach on the reading and writing abilities of English language learners (ELLs) in all 13 secondary schools in the district. Students receiving cognitive strategies instruction significantly out-gained peers on holistically scored assessments of academic writing for seven consecutive years. Treatment-group students also performed significantly better than control-group students on GPA, standardized tests, and high-stakes writing assessments. Findings reinforce the importance of having high expectations for ELLs; exposing them to a rigorous language arts curriculum;explicitly teaching, modeling and providing guided practice in a variety of strategies to help students read and write about challenging texts; and involving students as partners in a community of learners. What distinguishes the project is its integrity with respect to its fidelity to three core dimensions: Teachers and students were exposed to an extensive set of cognitive strategies and a wide array of curricular approaches to strategy use (comprehensiveness) in a manner designed to cultivate deep knowledge and application of those strategies in reading and writing (density) over an extended period of time (duration).

In this work, we evaluate Bayesian networks at detecting the learning style of a student in a Web-based education system. The Bayesian network models different aspects of a student behavior while he/she works with this system. Then, it infers his/her learning styles according to the modeled behaviors. The proposed Bayesian model was evaluated in the context of an Artificial Intelligence Web-based course. The results obtained are promising as regards the detection of students’ learning styles.

A three-dimensional model--based on the student (local or international), the teacher (local or international), and the curriculum (local, imported, or international)-offers a range of perspectives for international medical education.

In the branch-campus model, students, usually local, have an imported curriculum taught jointly by international and local teachers. The future of medical education, facilitated by the new learning technologies and pedagogies, lies in a move from such international interconnected approaches, which emphasize the mobility of students, teachers, and curriculum across the boundaries of two countries, to a transnational approach in which internationalization is integrated and embedded within a curriculum and involves collaboration between a number of schools in different countries.

An interesting question is how machines can help us infer about students' learning processes of composite concepts from students' external performance. Since Bayesian networks have been used in student modeling in many research projects, we employ them for simulating students' performance in taking tests, and seek methods for learning the original networks based on the simulated students' performance. The problem is not easy because the data we can observe have only indirect and uncertain relationship with the variables for mastery levels, and we would like to know the relationships among these hidden variables. We applied mutual information and artificial neural networks for this learning problem, and we achieved 75% in accuracy even when the item responses have really uncertain relationships with the actual mastery levels.","",""

The development of an ITS is often criticized for being a complex and challenging process as individual students' needs change and often they do not realize that they need help. Consequently, such a system must be capable of dynamically adapting and monitoring each student, developing a model of their knowledge, skills and expertise. Based on the learner student model, an ITS must present instructional strategies in terms of both the content and the style, and provides explanations and practice problems as needed. The advances in the development of the computer technologies has facilitated the use and design of ITS. Nevertheless, ITS research progress has been impeded by the lack of modular system architectures, reusable components and sharable knowledge bases. Each new research or development effort typically starts from scratch, without a foundation on which to build. In this paper some of the actual limiting problems of the ITS are studied. The main contribution of this work is resumed in a proposed framework. The framework incorporates a knowledge base where data and knowledge related to the problem are maintained and a model related to the student, teaching and environmental issues together with pedagogical perspectives. We consider in the ITS context the agents' technology for address issues of modularity and reusability; and Case-Based Reasoning to store students' interactions and feedback with the ITS, in order to maintain past memory experiences and then derive new paths for teaching.","",""

With their multi-modal perception, the aptitude of an interlocutor in identifying them, through a diversity of behaviors such as face movements, gestures, speech, is a fundamental aspect as judgment and decision making are influenced by mood, feelings, which facilitates human adaptation and social integration. In a cognitive activity such as learning, communication (between learners and tutors) is one of the fundamental issues, and its quality may influence the learning. Therefore, learning process implies cognitive aspects as well as socio-emotional aspects: in real world, teaching also implies to observe the student's affective behavior in order to detect affective responses which can express interest, excitation, confusion, etc. and suggest a review of the actual interaction flow.

As a result, MAUT provides a way for the system to select on the fly the best possible advice to be presented to users. Advice is dynamically formed based on adaptive presentation techniques, where adaptation is performed at the content level and adaptive navigation support, which is performed at the link level of the hyperspace of the tutoring system. The adaptivity of learning depends on factors such as the learner’s habits, prior knowledge and skills, which are used as criteria for the application of MAUT in the educational software.

Applications that adapt to individual users need a model of the user that contains as accurate data as possible. On the web, learners use multiple educational systems and spend their time over many applications: these are individually limited in their user modelling but can gain from joining forces. This boils down to establishing semantic interoperability of user or learner models. While semantic interoperability is hard, the emerging Semantic Web (SW) might offer just the mechanisms we need. In this paper, we develop the Generic User model Component (GUC): a generic software that utilises SW technology to support the exchange of user model data between applications. For a semantically effective user model exchange, GUC allows the configuration of a distributed management of mappings between user models. Thus, applications can choose different levels of uniting user models to maximise their personalisation.","Online education -- Usage, Semantic networks -- Usage, Engineering and manufacturing industries",""

Based on individual difference of learners' abilities and preferred learning styles in hypermedia environment, the learning outcomes vary essentially. Meanwhile, with the development of e-learning technologies, learners can be provided more effective learning environment to optimize their learning. Adaptive e-learning systems are built to personalize and adapt e-learning content, pedagogical models, and interactions between participants in the environment to meet the individual needs and preferences of users if and when they arise. The learner model is an essential component in adaptive e-learning systems since it is used to modify the interaction between system and learners to suit the needs of individual learners. While learner model plays an important role in the personalization of e-learning systems, it is seen as a part of the e-learning system in many applications. In our paper, we first explain the reason of why this issue prevents the e-learning systems to provide better personalized support to meet the individual learning requirements. Then we propose a novel centralized learner model technique for e-learning systems to overcome those problems. To achieve the goal to design a learner model for distributed systems meeting the requirements, the paper introduce five work steps: analyze e-learning standards, articulate modeling requirements, develop the representation of learning styles, generate learner activity ontology and design the learner model. Finally, we illustrate the architectural design of modeling system","",""

They have the capability of reaching learners in remote areas around the country or across country boundaries at very low cost. Personalized VLEs are those VLEs that provide a set of personalization functionalities, such as personalizing learning plans, learning materials, tests, and are capable of initializing the interaction with learners by providing advice, necessary instant messages, etc., to online learners. One of the major challenges involved in developing personalized VLEs is to achieve effective personalization functionalities, such as personalized content management, learner model, learner plan and adaptive instant interaction. Autonomous intelligent agents provide an important technology for accomplishing personalization in VLEs. A number of agents work collaboratively to enable personalization by recognizing an individual's eLeaming pace and reacting correspondingly. In this research, a personalization model has been developed that demonstrates dynamic eLeaming processes; secondly, this study proposes an architecture for PVLE by using intelligent decision-making agents' autonomous, pre-active and proactive behaviors. A prototype system has been developed to demonstrate the implementation of this architecture. Furthermore, a field experiment has been conducted to investigate the performance of the prototype by comparing PVLE eLearning effectiveness with a non-personalized VLE. Data regarding participants' final exam scores were collected and analyzed. The results indicate that intelligent agent technology can be employed to achieve personalization in VLEs, and as a consequence to improve eLeaming effectiveness dramatically.","Electronics, Electronique, Computer science, Informatique, Sciences exactes et technologie, Exact sciences and technology, Sciences appliquees, Applied sciences, Recherche operationnelle.

Research suggests that knowledge is processed and represented in different ways and that students prefer to use different types of resources in distinct ways. However, building Adaptive Educational systems that adapt to different learning characteristics is not easy. Major research questions exist such as: how are the relevant learning characteristics identified, how does modelling of the learner take place and in what way should the learning environment change for users with different learning characteristics? EDUCE is one system that addresses these challenges by using Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences (MI) as the basis for dynamically modelling learning characteristics and for designing instructional material. This paper describes a research study, using EDUCE, that explores the effect of using different adaptive presentation strategies and the impact on learning performance when material is matched and mismatched with learning preferences. The results suggest that students with low levels of learning activity, and who use only a limited number of the resources available, have the most to benefit from adaptive presentation strategies and that surprisingly learning gain increases when they are provided with resources not normally preferred.","Student modelling, Learning characteristics, Learning styles, Instructional design, Multiple intelligences",""

Courses are modelled by outline graphs, which are further refined by some form of process algebra. The linguistic analysis of word fields referring to an application domain helps to set up these course outlines. Learners are modelled by classifying value combinations for their characteristic properties. Each learner type gives rise to intentions as well as rights and obligations in using a learning system. Intentions can be formalised as postconditions, while rights and obligations lead to deontic constraints. The intentions can be used for the personalisation of the learning system to a learner type. Finally, the management of data in an e-learning system is approached on two different levels dealing with the content of individual learning units and the integrated content of the whole system, respectively.

We find that two descriptions of tunnelling through a square barrier are particularly common. Students often state that tunnelling particles lose energy while tunnelling. When sketching wavefunctions, students also show a shift in the axis of oscillation, as if the height of the axis of oscillation indicated the energy of the particle. We find inconsistencies between students' conceptual, mathematical and graphical models of quantum tunnelling.

We define the learning scenario as a sequence of the hypermedia pages, representing particular knowledge units, and tests related to them. The scenario determination is a dynamic process that begins when a new student takes up a course. The opening scenario for this student is chosen as the consensus of the final scenarios of the students, who have already finished this course, and who belong to a class of the learners similar to the new one. We have elaborated the consensus‐based procedure for the scenario determination. Since this procedure operates on a set of similar learners, we have developed the conceptions of learner’s profile and students’ classification. The learner’s profile is proposed to include the attributes describing students’ personal data (as name, birthday etc.), their cognitive and learning styles as well as their usage data (represented by the learning scenarios). The students’ classification is based on a set of the basic attributes that seem to influence the learning effects. Their significance is verified during the learning process. We have also elaborated the procedure of reducing undistinguishable values of the attribute and removing useless attributes from the set of basic attributes. A learning procedure proposed, describes generally the situations when the scenario is modified, and the methods used for its modification.","research-article, Research paper, cat-EDUN, Education, cat-IKM, Information & knowledge management, cat-TLNG, Technology & learning, cat-ICT, Information & communications technology, cat-ISYS, Information systems, cat-CTEG, Communications technology, Intelligent tutoring system, Multimedia learning environment, Adaptive classification, Student model, Consensus method",""

In this paper I argue that even more important than semantics is pragmatics; that is, to really enhance web usability it is critical to capture and react to aspects of the end use context. Most centrally, to make the web truly responsive to human needs, we need to understand the ""users"" of the web and their purposes for using it. In this paper I elaborate this argument in the context of of e-learning systems. I propose an approach to the design of e-learning systems that I call the ecological approach. Moving from the open web to repositories of learning objects, I show how the ecological approach shows promise not only to allow information about learners actual interactions with learning objects to be naturally captured but also to allow it to be used in a multitude of ways to support learners and teachers in achieving their goals. In a phrase, the approach involves attaching models of learners to the learning objects they interact with, and then mining these models for patterns that are useful for various purposes. The ecological approach turns out to be highly suited to e-learning applications. It also has interesting implications for e-learning research, and perhaps even for research directions for semantic web research. Invited Commentary: Ramondt, L., Smith, T and Bradshaw, P.

This study was performed to evaluate a new training model that emphasizes the repetition of simple procedures.; Methods: Laparoscopic surgery was performed in rabbits (n=200) using conventional instruments. Gynaecologists (n=10) and medical students (n=10) performed a series of exercises during 20 full days training. Nephrectomy was chosen to evaluate and score laparoscopic skills, i.e. duration of surgery and complication rate, since it mimics the surgical challenge and involves dissection of major vessels. Each surgeon performed 20 nephrectomies, alternating left and right sides.; Results: Duration of surgery and complications decreased with training. For duration of surgery, a two-phase exponential decay learning curve, with different decays for gynaecologists and students, was observed. Gynaecologists achieved shorter operating times than students for real and calculated times in the first procedure (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001) and for calculated time in the last procedure (P=0.001). Severe complications were more frequent in students than in gynaecologists (P=0.0003).; Conclusion: The rabbit nephrectomy model is suitable for training in laparoscopic surgery. Since it implies the repetition of short and well-defined exercises, progression is easier to monitor and the necessity for continuous supervision is less, making training less expensive.","Laparoscopy*/adverse effects, Models, Animal*, Rabbits*, Nephrectomy/*education, Nephrectomy/*methods, Animals, Education, Continuing, Education, Medical, Gynecology/education, Humans, Nephrectomy/adverse effects, Students, Medical, Time Factors",""

Although sophisticated student modelling techniques are available in the literature for this purpose, they typically focus on performance of the learners. Individual cognitive attributes have largely been ignored till now. This paper describes a complementary approach that considers cognitive traits of learners that are in nature quite stable over one's lifetime. Individual profiling of learners' cognitive traits and cumulative analysis of various profiles within learners' communities have potential for adaptive systems to provide adaptivity not only to individual learners, but also to overarching web-based learning communities.

Similar phenomena occur worldwide; SMB's constitute a huge growth opportunity for high tech companies. However, the technological resources that they employ are - in general - in the early stages, and many of them are underfinanced. Moreover, entrepreneurs rarely possess the appropriate culture for smooth adoption of e-business high tech. In order to ease the process of introduction of business to business (B2B) in an SMB, our objective is to design an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to help SMB executives familiarize with the critical success factors (CSFs) involved in this process. Our model uses pedagogical agents known as learning companions (LCs) to help business people learn B2B concepts. LC's are agentified students that motivate learning. These LCs have different expertise levels so an entrepreneur can interact with the agent or agents that best suits them. Our model also uses inspectable student models to allow users of the ITS to reflect on acquired knowledge and update agents knowledge bases.","",""

On the other hand, fast and efficient initialization of the student model is necessary. Otherwise the tutoring system may lose its credibility in the first interactions with the student. In this paper we describe a framework for the initialization of student models in Web-based educational applications. The framework is called ISM. The basic idea of ISM is to set initial values for all aspects of student models using an innovative combination of stereotypes and the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm. In particular, a student is first assigned to a stereotype category concerning her/his knowledge level of the domain being taught. Then, the model of the new student is initialized by applying the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm among the students that belong to the same stereotype category with the new student. ISM has been applied in a language learning system, which has been used as a test-bed. The quality of the student models created using ISM has been evaluated in an experiment involving classroom students and their teachers. The results from this experiment showed that the initialization of student models was improved using the ISM framework.","initialization, machine learning for user modeling, stereotypes, student modeling, Web-based intelligent tutoring systems",""

The design of an ITS comprises two distinct features - a sophisticated computer programming feature which has to be programmed by a computer scientist and a comprehensive curriculum design feature which has to be developed by a curriculum specialist. Unfortunately, most of the existing ITS's were designed by AI researchers alone without much involvement of curriculum designers, education psychologists and/or subject specialists. These AI researchers were not primarily concerned about instructional issues and their main concerns were to test their research curiosities in the AI field with minimum involvement of other people.

The system uses Visual Basic, a Microsoft access database, and Macromedia Flash; and is hosted using Microsoft's Internet information services (US). An access database is used to store domain specific knowledge and model student knowledge, and an algorithm asks questions adoptively based on the student model, so that each student receives an individualized practice session. The student interface is easy-to-use and provides detailed feedback about practice question performance and status. Lessons on PLC timer and counter instructions were evaluated by 38 undergraduate manufacturing engineering students. Students made statistically significant learning gains as a result of taking the lessons, and rated them positively in terms of ease of use and understanding, clear objectives, amount of interaction, ability to motivate, relevance, and pace.","",""

Based on the domain ontology, domain task ontology and case data, the abstract problem-solving methods of the expert model create a dynamic solution graph. Student interaction with the solution graph is filtered through an instructional layer, which is created by a second set of abstract problem-solving methods and pedagogic ontologies, in response to the current state of the student model.

We introduce a general framework for the initialization of the student model in Web-based educational applications. According to the framework, the student modeler makes initial estimations of the new student's knowledge level and error proneness based on the models of other similar students. This is done by applying a machine learning technique. The similarity between students is calculated taking into account different student characteristics for different teaching domains. We have implemented the proposed methodology in two different tutoring domains, namely language learning and mathematics. An evaluation study conducted in the case of the Web-based language learning system, showed that the use of the framework can initialize student models in a sufficiently accurate way, given the little information about individuals available.","",""

This information is used by other agents in order to provide individualised help and tutoring. The LM Agent interacts with a learner modelling server through Web services. In this way, each learner model is available to any client application that requests it.

As a result, ITSs limit the use of learner's profile in one tutoring system. We propose a learner agent concept that allows a profile to encompass multiple learning activities. We discuss how the learner agent is used as the student model of an ITS. We also focus on how the learner agent collects and stores information into this profile.","",""

An individualized navigation graph is constructed for each student, suggesting the competences the student is more prepared to study. We use fuzzy set theory for dealing with uncertainty. The marks of the assessment tests are transformed into linguistic terms and used for assigning values to linguistic variables. For each competence, the level of difficulty and the level of knowing its prerequisites are calculated based on the assessment marks. Using these linguistic variables and approximate reasoning (fuzzy IF-THEN rules), a crisp category is assigned to each competence regarding its level of recommendation.","",""
