The approach is informed by our previous work describing the development of expertise in classification problem solving in Pathology. The architecture envelops the traditional Intelligent Tutoring System design within the Unified Problem-solving Method description Language (UPML) architecture, supporting component modularity and reuse. Based on the domain ontology, domain task ontology and case data, the abstract problem-solving methods of the expert model create a dynamic solution graph. Student interaction with the solution graph is filtered through an instructional layer, which is created by a second set of abstract problem-solving methods and pedagogic ontologies, in response to the current state of the student model. We outline the advantages and limitations of this general approach, and describe it's implementation in SlideTutor - a developing Intelligent Tutoring System in Dermatopathology.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=14728159&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The construction of a network involves qualitative and quantitative aspects. The qualitative part concerns the network topology, that is, causal relations among the domain variables. After it is ready, the quantitative part is specified. It is composed of the distribution of conditional probability of the variables represented. A negotiation process (managed by an intelligent MediatorAgent) will treat the differences of topology and probability distribution between the model the learner built and the one built-in in the system. That negotiation process occurs between the agents that represent the expert knowledge domain (DomainAgent) and the agent that represents the learner knowledge (LearnerAgent).","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=12667742&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Diagnosing a learner's cognitive capacity is a crucial issue in building adaptive systems. We have explored an interactive open learner modelling (IOLM) approach which conceives diagnosis as an interactive process involving both a computer system and a learner that discuss and together construct the learner model. This paper outlines the architecture of an interactive open learner modelling system and illustrates the method in a terminological domain. We discuss an evaluative study of an IOLM demonstrator – a system called STyLE-OLM. The results from the study demonstrate potential benefits of the method for improving the quality of the learner model and providing a means for fostering reflective thinking. We argue that IOLM is a fruitful approach which may be employed in intelligent learning environments both for obtaining a better model of a learner's cognitive state and engaging learners in reflective activities.

Roberts and Park (1983) defines AI as the attempt to get computers to perform tasks that if performed by a human-being, intelligence would be required to perform the task. The design of an ITS comprises two distinct features - a sophisticated computer programming feature which has to be programmed by a computer scientist and a comprehensive curriculum design feature which has to be developed by a curriculum specialist. Unfortunately, most of the existing ITS's were designed by AI researchers alone without much involvement of curriculum designers, education psychologists and/or subject specialists. These AI researchers were not primarily concerned about instructional issues and their main concerns were to test their research curiosities in the AI field with minimum involvement of other people. This paper will analyze both features of an ITS; first, the four components (""problem-solving"" or ""expertise module,"" ""student model,"" ""tutoring module"" and the ""user interface"") of an ITS will be described and then the nine elements (""objectives,"" ""content,"" ""learning activities,"" ""evaluation procedures,"" ""materials"" or ""resources,"" ""teaching strategies,"" ""time,"" ""grouping"" and ""space"") of a curriculum design will be explained.

We further discuss two of our own systems and show how different types of CALL programs can, nonetheless, share similar conceptual designs of a student model. First, we describe the German Tutor, an Intelligent Language Tutoring System (ILTS) for German as a Second Language which contains a parser and a grammar that analyze student input. The student model is based on student subject matter performance and provides feedback and remedial exercises suited to learner expertise. Second, we provide an overview of Geroline, an online distance education course for ab initio German learners, and its student model. We show how a student model can support computerized adaptive language testing for diagnostic purposes in a Web-based language learning environment which does not rely on parsing technology. Here, student scores from libraries of sentence-based exercises are used as the raw input for the model.

This study was performed to evaluate a new training model that emphasizes the repetition of simple procedures. Methods: Laparoscopic surgery was performed in rabbits (n=200) using conventional instruments. Gynaecologists (n=10) and medical students (n=10) performed a series of exercises during 20 full days training. Nephrectomy was chosen to evaluate and score laparoscopic skills, i.e. duration of surgery and complication rate, since it mimics the surgical challenge and involves dissection of major vessels. Each surgeon performed 20 nephrectomies, alternating left and right sides. Results: Duration of surgery and complications decreased with training. For duration of surgery, a two-phase exponential decay learning curve, with different decays for gynaecologists and students, was observed. Gynaecologists achieved shorter operating times than students for real and calculated times in the first procedure (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001) and for calculated time in the last procedure (P=0.001). Severe complications were more frequent in students than in gynaecologists (P=0.0003). Conclusion: The rabbit nephrectomy model is suitable for training in laparoscopic surgery. Since it implies the repetition of short and well-defined exercises, progression is easier to monitor and the necessity for continuous supervision is less, making training less expensive.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=14688180&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The Cairns region has developed an international education student model for regional Australia. This approach delineates ideas, pitfalls, structures, strategic directions, dos and don'ts, and future strategies for a region. A balanced scorecard approach ensures that both financial rewards and visionary strategies are coordinated. This approach also offers a vital pathway to delivering regional strategies, and to mapping, measuring and quantifying their results. It produces a spiral knowledge-growth, learning model that can deliver rapid and continuous development of educationally related ideas. Moreover, this approach is a pathway to continuous improvement, and a further move towards maintaining a competitive position in the dynamic global marketspace of international education.

Specifically, we focus on two critical issues in intelligent tutoring - student diagnosis and generation of adaptive explanations. Both tasks are demonstrated in terminological domains where learners have to familiarize themselves with concepts in a specific subject area (e.g. computing, finance, chemistry). Based on CG reasoning, robust and computationally tractable algorithms for student modelling and adaptive explanation generation are defined. Two intelligent systems are presented — STyLE-OLM and HYLITE+. STyLE-OLM is an interactive learner modelling system that extracts extended models of the learners' cognition. HYLITE+ is a natural language generation system that generates adaptive Web pages based on a learner model(LM). The two systems are complementary and have been implemented separately. However, considered together they cover most of the key tasks in adaptive web-based educational hypermedia that aid learning technical terminology. Based on evaluative studies of STyLE-OLM and HYLITE+, the use of CGs for interactive open student modelling and adaptive concept explanations is examined.

The proposed system can effectively infer the state of the student''s knowledge. The knowledge state is diagnosed through the cases that are generated when the student solves a problem. We have chosen a procedural learning in the physics and designed this domain. In solving this problem, the knowledge types can be divided into the declarative and the procedural knowledge. Procedural knowledge is represented as the graphical case that constitutes a set of nodes and arcs. Declarative knowledge is represented as the analytical case that constitutes attribute-value pairs. In this study, we have implemented the intelligent tutoring system using case-based student model. We have estimated the performance between the human expert and the proposed system to prove the validity of this study. As a result, we have found that the inference method of the proposed system is similar to the human expert.

A typical application where such a technique can be useful is Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT). A Bayesian modeling scheme, POKS, is proposed and compared to the traditional Item Response Theory (IRT), which has been the prevalent CAT approach for the last three decades. POKS is based on the theory of knowledge spaces and constructs item-to-item graph structures without hidden nodes. It aims to offer an effective knowledge assessment method with an efficient algorithm for learning the graph structure from data. We review the different Bayesian approaches to modeling student ability assessment and discuss how POKS relates to them. The performance of POKS is compared to the IRT two parameter logistic model. Experimental results over a 34 item Unix test and a 160 item French language test show that both approaches can classify examinees as master or non-master effectively and efficiently, with relatively comparable performance. However, more significant differences are found in favor of POKS for a second task that consists in predicting individual question item outcome. Implications of these results for adaptive testing and student modeling are discussed, as well as the limitations and advantages of POKS, namely the issue of integrating concepts into its structure.

Researchers attempt to comprehend the misconception that led students to choose a specific erroneous answer in order to decide what needs to be explained to that particular student and this information is kept in the student model. However, the work done to date concentrates on what students learn correctly as a guideline of their progress and does not take into consideration how misconceptions may affect learning of dependant materials. This paper, studies two distinct effects of inducing misconceptions and then correcting them on student learning. The first experiment investigates of student seek ""semantic"" interpretations of the question and the process of correction. If the correcting is in a distance then will student react in a way similar to that if they are shown a moving scene. The second investigates how students use analogies, in learning from one concept what adversely affects another. Results indicate that misconception do affect student learning and the correction process is ""semantically"" interpreted. This informs designers of tutoring systems, to investigate to best correct misconceptions without causing unintended outcomes.

Traditional training is not indiscriminate but takes on different forms according to the needs of the subject being trained and the context where such training occurs. In order to make the systems adaptable in this way, a model of the student's characteristics - the student model - has to be set up, maintained and updated. However, there are many difficulties involved in obtaining sufficient information to create an accurate student model. One way to solve this problem is to involve students in the student modeling process, stimulating them to provide the necessary information by means of a dialog in which the student and system build the student model according to a collaborative process. The present work describes a cooperative student modeling method (Cooperative Student Assessment - CSA) which builds a joint system-student assessment of student's activities on the basis of the student's self-assessment ability estimation and a prototype system for children, addressing the learning of fractions, in which CSA is implemented. The article also reports the result of an experimentation carried out with learners attending primary school aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of involving students in the assessment process by comparing two versions of the same system: one using cooperative student modeling and the other the traditional overlay model.

This presentation provides the results of a series of micro-ethnographic studies aimed at specifying a student model of digital literacy comprehension, the skills that underlie the model and the instructional contexts that invoke the use of these skills within a traditional classroom setting.

The ILE is called Web F-SMILE, it operates over the Web and is meant to help novice users learn basic skills of computer use. Tutoring is dynamically adapted to the individual learner based on the learner modelling component of the system and the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) that is employed to process the information about the user. As a result, MAUT provides a way for the system to select on the fly the best possible advice to be presented to users. Advice is dynamically formed based on adaptive presentation techniques, where adaptation is performed at the content level and adaptive navigation support, which is performed at the link level of the hyperspace of the tutoring system. The adaptivity of learning depends on factors such as the learner's habits, prior knowledge and skills, which are used as criteria for the application of MAUT in the educational software. In this way, a novel combination of MAUT with adaptive techniques is used for intelligent web-based tutoring.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ747787&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

In contrast to domains where the structure of the problem under consideration allows a constraint to (almost) uniquely determine the possible cause of a particular student error, there are other applications where a multitude of competing error explanations has to be considered. In such cases constraint-based models alone hardly meet the requirements for a student model. Instead a constraint-based model clearly serves the purpose of error diagnosis and needs to be complemented by additional components for diagnosis selection based on general or individually tailored heuristics. By investigating the apparent and strong parallelism between constraint-based modeling and model-based diagnosis, this paper identifies four major sources of ambiguity that need to be considered when using constraint-based modeling and describes options for dealing with situations in which alternative error descriptions are available. Examples are primarily drawn from the area of foreign language learning.

This paper describes using knowledge tracing to construct a student model of reading proficiency and validates the model. We use speech recognition to assess a student's reading proficiency at a subword level, even though the speech recognizer output is at the level of words and is statistically noisy. Specifically, we estimate the student's knowledge of 80 letter to sound mappings, such as ch making the sound /K/ in ""chemistry."" At a coarse level, the student model did a better job at estimating reading proficiency for 47.2% of the students than did a standardized test designed for the task. Although not quite as strong as the standardized test, our assessment method can provide a report on the student at any time during the year and requires no break from reading to administer. Our model's estimate of the student's knowledge on individual letter to sound mappings is a significant predictor of whether he will ask for help on a particular word. Thus, our student model is able to describe student performance both at a coarse- and at a fine-grain size.

Description: During the 2003 to 2004 academic year, we conducted both our traditional single-learner-level morning report and a new highly interactive multiple-learner-level format. Attendees were rotating students, residents, and faculty on the inpatient general medicine services. Evaluation: We conducted anonymous surveys of participants to record their evaluations of the morning report formats. We received evaluations from 293 (60%) of 490 students, residents, and faculty. Students, 1st-year residents, and faculty preferred the mixed-learner model significantly more than did senior residents. Overall, more than 80% of participants rated the interactive multilevel format as good or very good when asked about content, discussion quality, level, and usefulness. Conclusions: An interactive morning report involving learners across multiple levels was well-received and has several educational benefits, with a greater emphasis on collaborative case discussion and active learning. Education leaders should remain open to experimenting with even the most well-established institutional traditions as they continuously reevaluate the effectiveness of teaching conferences.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=17144839&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

They have the capability of reaching learners in remote areas around the country or across country boundaries at very low cost. Personalized VLEs are those VLEs that provide a set of personalization functionalities, such as personalizing learning plans, learning materials, tests, and are capable of initializing the interaction with learners by providing advice, necessary instant messages, etc., to online learners. One of the major challenges involved in developing personalized VLEs is to achieve effective personalization functionalities, such as personalized content management, learner model, learner plan and adaptive instant interaction. Autonomous intelligent agents provide an important technology for accomplishing personalization in VLEs. A number of agents work collaboratively to enable personalization by recognizing an individual''s eLearning pace and reacting correspondingly. In this research, a personalization model has been developed that demonstrates dynamic eLearning processes; secondly, this study proposes an architecture for PVLE by using intelligent decision-making agents'' autonomous, pre-active and proactive behaviors. A prototype system has been developed to demonstrate the implementation of this architecture. Furthermore, a field experiment has been conducted to investigate the performance of the prototype by comparing PVLE eLearning effectiveness with a non-personalized VLE. Data regarding participants'' final exam scores were collected and analyzed. The results indicate that intelligent agent technology can be employed to achieve personalization in VLEs, and as a consequence to improve eLearning effectiveness dramatically.

Factors encouraging internationalization include (1) globalization of health care delivery, (2) governmental pressures, (3) improved communication channels, (4) development of a common vocabulary, (5) outcome-based education and standards, (6) staff development initiatives, and (7) competitiveness and commercialization. A three-dimensional model--based on the student (local or international), the teacher (local or international), and the curriculum (local, imported, or international)-offers a range of perspectives for international medical education. In the traditional approach to teaching and learning medicine, local students and local teachers use a local curriculum. In the international medical graduate or overseas student model, students from one country pursue in another country a curriculum taught and developed by teachers in the latter. In the branch-campus model, students, usually local, have an imported curriculum taught jointly by international and local teachers. The future of medical education, facilitated by the new learning technologies and pedagogies, lies in a move from such international interconnected approaches, which emphasize the mobility of students, teachers, and curriculum across the boundaries of two countries, to a transnational approach in which internationalization is integrated and embedded within a curriculum and involves collaboration between a number of schools in different countries. In this approach, the study of medicine is exemplified in the global context rather than the context of a single country. The International Virtual Medical School serves as an example in this regard.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=17086041&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Self-efficacy judgments are based on four sources of information: an individual's own past performance, vicarious experiences of observing the performances of others, verbal persuasion that one possesses certain capabilities, and physiological states. Individuals use these four sources of information to judge their capability to complete future tasks. Teachers who capitalize on the influence of the strongest of these sources-past performances, observations of others as models, and verbal persuasion-produce more confident students. The following instructional strategies increase student self-efficacy: • Reviewing lesson accomplishments from the previous day, posting the current lesson's objectives prior to instruction, drawing attention to the lesson objectives as they are covered, and reviewing the lesson objectives at the end of the lesson. • Asking students to record each day on a calendar something new they learned that day or something at which they excelled. • Prompting students who perform poorly to attribute their failures to lack of effort and encouraging them to try harder. • Drawing students' attention to their growth and complimenting them on their specific skills. • Using student models early to demonstrate some aspects of a lesson to remind them that other students like themselves are mastering the material and therefore they can master it also. Teachers who use these strategies on a daily basis produce students who are more confident in their academic skills.

However, for providing proper adaptivity, the learning styles of learners need to be known first. While most systems, which consider learning styles, use questionnaires in order to identify learning styles, we propose an automatic student modelling approach, which analyses the actual behaviour and actions of students during they are learning in an online course in order to infer students' learning styles. Such an automatic approach has the advantage that students do not have any additional effort for providing information about their learning styles. Additionally, an automatic approach can be more accurate by excluding extraordinary behaviour of students and adapting in the case that the learning styles changed over time. In this paper, we present an automatic student modelling approach for learning management system, which aims at identifying learning style preferences within the four dimensions of the Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM). The approach is based on patterns derived from literature and a simple rule-based method for calculating learning styles from the students' behaviour. The proposed approach is evaluated by a study with 75 students, comparing the results of the learning style questionnaire with the results obtained by the proposed automatic student modelling approach. As a result, the approach is appropriate for identifying all learning style preferences within the active/reflective dimension of FSLSM and some learning style preferences within the sensing/intuitive and visual/verbal dimension. For the sequential/global dimension, results of learning style preferences show only moderate precision.

Over an eight-year period, a relatively stable group of 55 secondary teachers engaged in ongoing professional development implemented a cognitive strategies approach to reading and writing instruction, making visible for approximately 2000 students per year the thinking tools experienced readers and writers access in the process of meaning construction. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of this approach on the reading and writing abilities of English language learners (ELLs) in all 13 secondary schools in the district. Students receiving cognitive strategies instruction significantly out-gained peers on holistically scored assessments of academic writing for seven consecutive years. Treatment-group students also performed significantly better than control-group students on GPA, standardized tests, and high-stakes writing assessments. Findings reinforce the importance of having high expectations for ELLs; exposing them to a rigorous language arts curriculum;explicitly teaching, modeling and providing guided practice in a variety of strategies to help students read and write about challenging texts; and involving students as partners in a community of learners. What distinguishes the project is its integrity with respect to its fidelity to three core dimensions: Teachers and students were exposed to an extensive set of cognitive strategies and a wide array of curricular approaches to strategy use (comprehensiveness) in a manner designed to cultivate deep knowledge and application of those strategies in reading and writing (density) over an extended period of time (duration).

Work on personalisation and adaptivity has included research into allowing the student user to enhance the system's adaptivity by improving the accuracy of the underlying learner model. Open Learner Modelling, where the system's model of the user's knowledge is revealed to the user, has been proposed to support student reflection on their learning. Increased accuracy of the learner model can be obtained by the student and system jointly negotiating the learner model. We present the initial investigations into a system to allow people to negotiate the model of their understanding of a topic in natural language. This paper discusses the development and capabilities of both conversational agents (or chatbots) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems, in particular Open Learner Modelling. We describe a Wizard-of-Oz experiment to investigate the feasibility of using a chatbot to support negotiation, and conclude that a fusion of the two fields can lead to developing negotiation techniques for chatbots and the enhancement of the Open Learner Model. This technology, if successful, could have widespread application in schools, universities and other training scenarios.

A diagnosis procedure which uses adaptive testing is part of this approach. Adaptive tests provide well-founded and accurate diagnosis thanks to the underlying probabilistic theory, i.e., theItem Response Theory. Most adaptive testing proposals are based on dichotomous models, where he student answer can only be considered either correct or incorrect. In the work described here, a polytomous model has been used, i.e., answers can be given partial credits. Thus, models are more informative and diagnosis is more efficient. This paper also presents an algorithm for estimating question characteristic curves, which are necessary in order to apply the Item Response Theory to a given domain and hence must be inferred before testing begins. Most prior estimation procedures need huge sets of data. We have modified preexisting procedures in such a way that data requirements are significantly reduced. Finally, this paper presents the results of some controlled evaluations that have been carried out in order to analyze the feasibility and advantages of this approach.

However, as yet there is no standard way of describing and analysing these 'open learner models'. This is, in part, due to the variety of issues that can be important or relevant in any particular learner model. The lack of a framework to discuss open learner models poses several difficulties: there is no systematic way to analyse and describe the open learner models of any one system; there is no systematic way to compare the features of open learner models in different systems; and the designers of each new adaptive learning system must repeatedly tread the same path of studying the many diverse uses and approaches of open learner modelling so that they might determine how to make use of open learner modelling in their system. We believe this is a serious barrier to the effective use of open learner models. This paper presents such a framework, and gives examples of its use to describe and compare adaptive educational systems.

The systems present a high-level abstraction of the detailed information contained in the student model, in terms of skill meters representing the student's progress on domain concepts. SQL-Tutor presents the open student model when the student requires it, or when selecting new problems. KERMIT, on the other hand, continuously displays a high-level summary of the student's progress, while more detailed information is available on request. Our results show that even simple open student models can have important positive effects on learning and students' meta-cognitive skills. Students appreciated having access to their models, and they felt this feature contributed to their understanding of the domain. Performance of less able students becomes significantly better than that of their peers of similar abilities without access to their models. We have also seen that open student models can help students learn to select better problems.

To meet two challenges of motivation and interactivity for open learner models, the concept of open learner models as animal companions is proposed based on the emotional attachment of humans towards pets. Animal companions adopt three strategies and play various educational roles to help children's learning in motivation, reflection and member interactions. A class of students is divided into several teams. A student keeps her own individual animal companion, called My-Pet, which holds the open learner model of the student, and each team has a team animal companion, called Our-Pet, which owns their open group learner model. A preliminary experiment is conducted in a fifth-grade class with 31 eleven year old students in an elementary school to collect initial feedback in cognitive and affective aspects.

Tutoring dialogues are used by learners to explicitly reveal their own knowledge state to themselves. Dewey's theory of reflective thinking is used to create tutorial strategies which govern these dialogues. Drake's specification of critical thinking, associated to a defined set of skills, is used to define tutoring tactics implementing these strategies. The main contribution of this approach to OLM is that it provides a set of principled and reusable tutorial strategies and tactics to promote reflection, as they are based on domain independent theories. Furthermore, an evaluation of such a principled approach to OLM is straightforward in certain cases, as it refers to theories which already provide evaluation criteria. The approach is integrated in Prolog-Tutor, an existing intelligent tutoring system for Logic Programming. This paper presents a qualitative study of the resulting system, based on think-aloud protocols. A result analysis reveals that explicitly fostering reflection supports reflection based OLM and provides landmarks to explain its manifestations. However, the results also suggest that this openness may be less helpful when used by learners who have already honed a high level of proficiency in logic programming.

Analyses of suspension data over a three-year period were conducted to explain between-school variability in the percentages of Black students suspended in secondary schools at a large urban school district. Results of hierarchical backward elimination indicated that suspensions could be explained by the suspension percentages of non-Black students, increases in achievement discrepancies between Black and non-Black students, and schools' average years of experience of the instructional staff. With these variables in the model, the percentages of Black student enrollment, of Black instructional staff, of male instructional staff, and of novice instructional staff did not predict Black student suspension. The percentages of students who participated in the free/reduced lunch program was initially retained in the student model, but was replaced by the experience of the instructional staff.

The UMPTEEN approach was developed in order to investigate students' views about releasing their learner model more widely, and to observe how they use their own and peer models. This paper presents the first results from a lab-based study of an open learner model that can be optionally opened to others, in named and/or anonymous form.

Active reports are designed to foster communication among teachers, students, and parents by listening to all stakeholders, using assessment information to guide teaching and learning, and to reconcile potential conflicts. Open student models can handle different views of the student. These views support different kinds of assessment information coming from a variety of sources (e.g. results from summative and formative assessments). As teachers, students, and parents interact with open student models, assessment claims (e.g. students' self-assessment, systems' and teachers' assessment of student knowledge) may evolve from unsupported claims to evidence-based arguments. Paths on this evidentiary argument space are characterized by rich interactions among sources of evidence that may challenge personal claims and improve metacognitive skills. This paper (a) presents an evidence-based approach to interacting with open student models that builds on existing research on open student models, evidentiary arguments and evidence-centered design, (b) illustrates this approach in the context of an assessment-based learning environment called Math Intervention Module (MIM), and (c) reports on a study carried out with Algebra teachers/assessment specialists aimed at evaluating the feasibility of implementing this approach in real settings.

There are many aspects of the learner that can be modelled, and many of these aspects may need to be opened in different ways. In addition, there may be complicated interactions between these aspects which raise questions both about the accuracy of the underlying model and the methods for representing a holistic view of the model. There can also be complex processes involved in inferring the learner's state, and opening up views onto these processes – which leads to the issues that are the main focus of this paper: namely, how can we open up the process of interpreting the learner's behaviour in such a manner that the learner can both understand the process and challenge the interpretation in a meaningful manner. The paper provides a description of the design and implementation of an open learner model (termed the xOLM) which features an approach to breaking free from the limitations of ""black box"" interpretation. This approach is based on a Toulmin-like argumentation structure together with a form of data fusion based on an adaptation of Dempster-Shafer. However, the approach is not without its problems. The paper ends with a discussion of the possible ways in which open learner models might open up the interpretation process even more effectively.

These models are especially suited to building inference engines designed to be synchronous with the finer grained student models that arise in skills diagnostic assessment. Aspects of the theory and use of Bayesian network models are reviewed, as they affect applications to diagnostic assessment. The paper discusses how Bayesian network models are set up with expert information, improved and calibrated from data, and deployed as evidence-based inference engines. Aimed at a general educational measurement audience, the paper illustrates the flexibility and capabilities of Bayesian networks through a series of concrete examples, and without extensive technical detail. Examples are provided of proficiency spaces with direct dependencies among proficiency nodes, and of customized evidence models for complex tasks. This paper is intended to motivate educational measurement practitioners to learn more about Bayesian networks from the research literature, to acquire readily available Bayesian network software, to perform studies with real and simulated data sets, and to look for opportunities in educational settings that may benefit from diagnostic assessment fueled by Bayesian network modeling.

For example, the short message and browsing functions in a cell phone provide users with timely and adaptive information access. Although many studies of mobile learning indicate the pedagogical potential of mobile devices, the screen size, computational power, battery capacity, input interfaces, and network bandwidth are too restricted to develop acceptable functionality for the entire learning processes in a handheld device. Therefore, mobile devices can be adopted to fill the gap between Web-based learning and ubiquitous mobile learning. This study first creates a website, providing functions enabling learning to take place anytime and anywhere with any available learning device, for ubiquitous learning according to various properties of mobile devices. Nowadays, learners' behaviors on a website can be recorded as learning portfolios and analyzed for behavioral diagnosis or instructional planning. A student model is then built according to the analytical results of learning portfolios and a concept map of the learning domain. Based on the student model and learners' available learning devices, three modules are developed to build a ubiquitous learning environment to enhance learning performance via learning status awareness, schedule reminders and mentor recommendation. Finally, an experiment is conducted with 54 college students after implementation of the ubiquitous learning website. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system can enhance three learning performance indicators, namely academic performance, task accomplishment rates, and learning goals achievement rates.

In the scientific area of User Modeling (UM), numerous research and developed systems already seem to promise good results, but some experimentation and implementation are still necessary to conclude about the utility of the UM. That is, the experimentation and implementation of these systems are still very scarce to determine the utility of some of the referred applications. At present, the Student Modeling research goes in the direction to make possible reuse a student model in different systems. The standards are more and more relevant for this effect, allowing systems communicate and to share data, components and structures, at syntax and semantic level, even if most of them still only allow syntax integration.

Student models include a range of information about the learners such as their domain competence, learning style or cognitive traits. To be able to adapt to the learners' needs in an appropriate way, a reliable student model is necessary, but getting enough information about a learner is quite challenging. Therefore, mechanisms are needed to support the detection process of the required information. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between learning styles, in particular, those pertaining to the Felder-Silverman learning style model and working memory capacity, one of the cognitive traits included in the cognitive trait model. The identified relationship is derived from links between learning styles, cognitive styles, and working memory capacity which are based on studies from the literature. As a result, we demonstrate that learners with high working memory capacity tend to prefer a reflective, intuitive, and sequential learning style whereas learners with low working memory capacity tend to prefer an active, sensing, visual, and global learning style. This interaction can be used to improve the student model. Systems which are able to detect either only cognitive traits or only learning styles retrieve additional information through the identified relationship. Otherwise, for systems that already incorporate learning styles and cognitive traits, the interaction can be used to improve the detection process of both by including the additional information of a learning style into the detection process of cognitive traits and vice versa. This leads to a more reliable student model.

The method has been developed during the European funded projects Diogene and Intraserv, focused on the construction of an adaptive e-learning platform. The aim of the platform is the automatic generation and personalization of courses, taking into account pedagogical knowledge on the didactic domain as well as statistic information on both the student’s knowledge degree and learning preferences. Pedagogical information is described by means of an innovative methodology suitable for effective and efficient course generation and personalization. Moreover, statistic information can be collected and exploited by the system in order to better describe the student’s preferences and learning performances. Learning material is chosen by the system matching the student’s learning preferences with the learning material type, following a pedagogical approach suggested by Felder and Silverman. The paper discusses how automatic learning material personalization makes it possible to facilitate distance learning access to both able-bodied and disabled people. Results from the Diogene and Intraserv evaluation are reported and discussed.

The system presents the learner with their learner model, offering them the opportunity to compare their own beliefs regarding their capabilities with those inferred by the system. A conversational agent, or “chatbot” has been developed to allow the learner to negotiate over the representations held about them using natural language. The system aims to support the metacognitive goals of self-assessment and reflection, which are increasingly seen as key to learning and are being incorporated into UK educational policy. The paper describes the design of the system, and reports a user trial, in which the chatbot was found to support users in increasing the accuracy of their self-assessments, and in reducing the number of discrepancies between system and user beliefs in the learner model. Some lessons learned in the development have been highlighted and future research and experimentation directions are outlined.

Such systems capture and represent, for each student, various characteristics such as knowledge and traits in an individual learner model. Subsequently, using the resulting model it dynamically adapts the learning environment for each student in a manner that attempts to best support learning. However, there are some unresolved issues in building adaptive educational systems that adapt to individual traits. For example in what way should the learning environment support users with different learning characteristic and what advantage does adaptive control have over learner control. This article describes an experiment using the Multiple Intelligence based adaptive intelligent educational system, EDUCE, that explores how the learning environment should change for users with different trait characteristics. In particular it explores the effect of using different adaptive presentation strategies in contrast to giving the learner complete control over the learning environment. Results suggest that students who do not explore alternative resources beyond the first presented resource have the most to benefit from adaptive presentation strategies. The results surprisingly suggest that learning gain increases for these students when they are provided with resources not normally preferred.

Analysis of 14 design reviews in 2 classrooms showed that re-contextualizing resulted in both the elaboration of ideas students already understood and new contributions to students' understandings of mathematical aspects of population modeling. This article presents case studies of 2 groups that differed in terms of their interest in the curricular task and the level of conceptual integrity of their population models. Despite these differences, the re-contextualizing exchanges that emerged in their design reviews led to new insights for both groups and provided them with opportunities to try on ways of thinking and acting like population biologists.

We provide an exploration of this problem using heuristic methods, search methods, and machine-learning techniques, while employing Bayesian networks as the language for representing the student models. Given experts' expectation about students and simulated students' responses to test items that were designed for the concepts, we try to find the Bayesian-network structure that best represents how students learn the composite concept of interest. The experiments were conducted with only simulated students. The accuracy achieved by the proposed classification methods spread over a wide range, depending on the quality of collected input evidence. We discuss the experimental procedures, compare the experimental results observed in certain experiments, provide two ways to analyse the influences of Q-matrices on the experimental results, and we hope that this simulation-based experience may contribute to the endeavours in mapping the human learning process.

We will use Matthews' three adequacy criteria to review recent research in construction grammar and propose its application in ICALL, particularly in projects which involve the building of a student model. Such a student modeling project - Mocha - will be sketched briefly to provide a concrete context for the conceptualisation and implementation of construction grammar. This grammatical framework has the potential to help overcome some challenges in ICALL and to facilitate a more thorough analysis of learner language in context and thus improve our knowledge about language learning processes.

The development of AMPLIA raised several research topics, due to the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Learning Environments. The core topics are: probabilistic diagnostic learning in the medical area, application of teaching strategies based on Pedagogical Negotiation (PN), construction of cognitive student models with probabilistic beliefs, and application of interoperability methods for pedagogical agents, and tutoring systems integration. An important aspect of AMPLIA is the utilization of PN as the main form of interaction. The impact of this approach on the system dynamics and on the student's learning is presented in detail. Considering the importance of cooperative work during the learning process, we describe how AMPLIA is used to enable cooperation. The description is based on experiments carried out with AMPLIA and its users. The main results of these experiments are reported as well.

This paper proposes an automatic approach for identifying students' learning styles in LMSs as well as a tool that supports teachers in applying this approach. The approach is based on inferring students' learning styles from their behaviour in an online course and was developed for LMSs in general. It has been evaluated by a study with 127 students, comparing the results of the automatic approach with those of a learning style questionnaire. The evaluation yielded good results and demonstrated that the proposed approach is suitable for identifying learning styles.

In web-based learning, chat rooms, e-mails, and bulletin boards play an important role in answering student stalled issues. However, the tutor has to be online at a specific time to support and answer students' questions. Unfortunately, repeated questions consume tutors' time and decrease the chances to serve more students during the time specified. Not to mention, the student time is not efficiently utilized due to the waiting time until being able to schedule and attend a chatting session with the tutor, or to wait for receiving a response to his/her question by e-mail or on a bulletin board. It is worth noting that psychologists recognized that each individual student has his own model that determines the best way to receive answers to questions, which differs from one student to another. The student model describes how individual students differ in their way of learning, therefore, adapting the answer to a question in such a way to match the student model would improve the efficiency of his/her understanding and, hence, elevates the learning effectiveness, according to psychologists. In this research, we approached the office hours' problem by supporting both students and tutors by automatic answering of students' repeatedly asked questions. We treated repeated questions similarly to frequently-asked-questions (FAQ) but with a novel manipulation to match the specific student model. Accordingly, we developed a model for a Smart Office Hours Assistant (SOHA) that imitates online office-hours' sessions in a manner that suites more the e-learning paradigm. In SOHA, different students will receive different versions of the answer to the same question. Among the considered student model attributes are background domain knowledge, learning styles, and IQ level. A framework for designing SOHA fore-learning and a prototype have also been developed under this research.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic student modelling approach, which monitors students' behaviour in a course and notices once the learning styles stored in the student model do not reflect students' behaviour in the course any more. The proposed approach aims, on one hand, at updating the information in the student model as soon as possible once differences in students' behaviour were detected but, on the other hand, also considers deviations in students' behaviour. In an experiment with data from 75 students, appropriate parameter settings and the suitability of all considered components were tested, showing that the proposed dynamic student modelling approach yields good results. By using this dynamic student modelling approach, a system is therefore able to revise the information in the student model when required and thus enable systems to provide students with support, learning material and activities they currently need.

Exploring how to optimally develop this skill is therefore of paramount importance to education researchers. This is certainly no less true in health care, where optimal patient care is contingent on the continuous efforts of doctors and other health care workers to provide the best care to their patients through the development and incorporation of new knowledge. Medical education programmes must therefore foster the skills and attitudes necessary to engage future doctors in the systematic development of innovative problem solving. The aim of this paper is to describe the perceptions and experiences of medical students in their third and fourth years of training, and to explore their understanding of their development as adaptive experts. Methods: A sample of 25 medical students participated in individual 45-60-minute semi-structured interviews. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and entered into NVivo qualitative data analysis software to facilitate a thematic analysis. The analysis was both inductive, in that themes were generated from the data, and deductive, in that our data were meaningful when interpreted in the context of theories of adaptive expertise. Results: Participants expressed a general belief that, as learners in the health care system, exerting any effort to be innovative was beyond the scope of their responsibilities. Generally, students suggested that innovative practice was the prerogative of experts and an outcome of expert development centred on the acquisition of knowledge and experience. Conclusions: Students' perceptions of themselves as having no responsibility to be innovative in their learning process have implications for their learning trajectories as adaptive experts.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=19161482&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

It is often considered as a collaboration between students and the system to promote learners’ reflection and to collaboratively assess the course. When adaptive learning environments are used in the classroom, teachers act as a guide through the learning process. Thus, they need to monitor students’ interactions in order to understand and evaluate their activities. Although, the knowledge gained through this monitorization can be extremely useful to student modeling, collaboration between teachers and the system to achieve this goal has not been considered in the literature. In this paper we present a framework to support teachers in this task. In order to prove the usefulness of this framework we have implemented and evaluated it in an adaptive web-based educational system called PDinamet.

Much of the existing learner modeling research work focuses on identifying appropriate learner properties. Little attention, however, has been given to leverage Dynamic Decision Network (DDN) as a dynamic learner model to reason and intervene across time. Employing a DDN-based learner model in a scientific inquiry learning environment, however, remains at infant stage because there are factors contributed to the performance the learner model. Three factors have been identified to influence the matching accuracy of INQPRO's learner model. These factors are the structure of DDN model, the variable instantiation approach, and the weights assignment method for two consecutive Decision Networks (DNs). In this research work, a two-phase empirical study involving 107 learners and six domain experts was conducted to determine the optimal conditions for the INQPRO's dynamic learner model. The empirical results suggested each time-slice of the INQPRO's DDN should consist of a DN, and that DN should correspond to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) accessed. In light of evidence, observable variables should be instantiated to their observed states; leaving the remaining observable nodes uninstantiated. The empirical results also indicated that varying weights between two consecutive DNs could optimize the matching accuracy of INQPRO's dynamic learner model.

We assessed 11 students' atomic/molecular-level explanations of real-world phenomena after their participation in a modelling-based PNM unit. All 11 students offered a scientifically acceptable model regarding atomic/molecular behaviour in non-heated solids. Yet, 10 of 11 students expressed the view that, in response to added heat energy, atoms/molecules in a solid increase in movement to a degree beyond what is scientifically accepted. These students attributed a gas-like model of atomic/molecular movement to situations involving a heated solid. Of the students who held two conflicting models of atomic/molecular movement in solids, almost all provided justification for doing so, indicating their holding of the conflicting models was unproblematic. These findings can be interpreted to mean that students may drop constraints of certain scientific representations and apply, assess, or revise models when explaining unfamiliar phenomena. In fact, we believe students may develop conflicting causal models as a result of misperceptions they acquire, in part, during classroom instruction regarding atomic/molecular movement. However, our findings may also be interpreted as an incidence of student model development that may later aid their understanding of a more complex model, one that involves substantial sub-atomic electron movement to account for heat transfer in solids. Whether or not this is the case remains to be seen. Implications for student learning and instruction are discussed.

This is particularly true of educational software designs where evoking positive emotions motivates interaction with the software. In this article, a description is given of the participatory design, development, evaluation, and use of a non-verbal, self-reporting instrument Soremo to measure children's emotional states while using educational software. Researchers and designers of children's educational software products alike are interested in capturing the emotional impact of application features on users' actions and learning processes. Soremo will be used to gain emotional feedback of a child's interaction with an open learner modelling tutoring system, which represents knowledge about children's learning progress, personal characteristics, and so on. The reported cross-cultural studies adopted a participatory-design approach, to create an instrument usable by French and English children. During the design process, the emotional responses to software, of French and English school children aged 4-13, were investigated. The article includes an evaluation of the method involving children using the instrument to represent emotional states. Future plans comprise deploying the method to design affective educational software products and assessing the impact on the children's learning experiences.

Adaptive web-based educational systems aim to cater individual learners by customizing courses to suit their needs. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of incorporating learning styles and cognitive traits in web-based educational systems. Adaptivity aspects based on cognitive traits and learning styles enrich each other, enabling systems to provide learners with courses which fit their needs more accurately. Furthermore, consideration of learning styles and cognitive traits can contribute to more accurate student modelling. In this paper, the relationship between learning styles, in particular the Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM), and working memory capacity, a cognitive trait, is investigated. For adaptive educational systems that consider either only learning styles or only cognitive traits, the additional information can be used to provide more holistic adaptivity. For systems that already incorporate both learning styles and cognitive traits, the relationship can be used to improve the detection process of both by including the additional information of learning style into the detection process of cognitive traits and vice versa. This leads to a more reliable student model.

This kind of e-learning is achieved through the resources of the Semantic Web and is designed and developed around a course, group of courses or specialty. An essential part of ILS is learner model database which contains structured data about learner profile and temporal status in the learning process of one or more courses. In the paper a learner model position in ILS is considered and a relational database is designed from learner’s domain ontology. Multidimensional modeling agent for the source database is designed and resultant learner data cube is presented. Agent’s modules are proposed with corresponding algorithms and procedures.

This paper presents a conceptual model that employs a synergistic approach based on Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Multicriteria Decision Making (MDM) components for learner modelling and feedback generation during exploration in an ill-defined domain of mathematical generalisation. The CBR component is used to diagnose what students are doing on the basis of simple and composite cases; simple cases represent parts of the models that the learners could possibly construct during an exploratory learning activity, while composite cases, which are assembled from simple cases, correspond to strategies that learners may adopt to construct their models. Similarity measures are used to identify how close/far are the learners from solutions pre-specified and stored in the knowledge base. This information is then fed into the MDM component that is responsible for prioritising types of feedback depending on the context. The operation of the two components and the effectiveness of the synergistic approach are validated through user scenarios in the context of an exploratory learning environment for mathematical generalisation.

The purposes of this study were to investigate the rates at which specific instructional practices (i.e., attention signals, prior knowledge supports, previews, instructor modeling, student modeling, organizational prompts) were utilized during literacy time in elementary schools, determine if there were relationships among the instructional variables, and explore if teachers in Title I schools and teachers in non-Title I schools differed in their use of specific practices. Participants included teachers and students from 35 classrooms who were each observed for 5 hours, resulting in a total of 175 observation hours. The Setting Factors Assessment Tool (SFAT) was used to measure the antecedent instructional variables. Main results included that teachers in non-Title I classrooms used significantly more prior knowledge references than teachers in Title I schools; the effect size for this finding was large. Several correlations among the instructional variables were significant.

Many of those systems have tackled fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics, and computer programming. The change of the student's cognitive behavior over time, however, has not been considered and modeled systematically. Furthermore, the nature of domain knowledge in specific subjects such as orthopedic surgery, in which pragmatic knowledge could play an important role, has also not been taken into account deliberately. We believe that the temporal dimension in modeling the student's knowledge state and cognitive behavior is critical, especially in such domains. In this paper, we propose an approach for student modeling and diagnosis, which is based on a symbiosis between temporal Bayesian networks and fine-grained didactic analysis. The latter may help building a powerful domain knowledge model and the former may help modeling the learner's complex cognitive behavior, so as to be able to provide him or her with relevant feedback during a problem-solving process. To illustrate the application of the approach, we designed and developed several key components of an intelligent learning environment for teaching the concept of sacro-iliac screw fixation in orthopedic surgery, for which we videotaped and analyzed six surgical interventions in a French hospital. A preliminary gold-standard validation suggests that our diagnosis component is able to produce coherent diagnosis with acceptable response time.

However, in order to provide students with such personalized recommendations and advice, their learning styles have to be identified first. In this paper, we introduce an architecture that aims at monitoring students' behaviour in online courses and using this information in order to build and frequently update a cognitive profile that consists of information about students' learning styles. Dynamic student modelling enables systems to incrementally learn students' learning styles, identify and consider exceptional behaviour of students, and update students' learning styles once they change over time. In order to quickly initialise the cognitive profile, the architecture additionally provides a learning style questionnaire that can (but does not have to) be used by students and therefore combines static and dynamic student modelling of learning styles. The proposed architecture can be easily integrated in different learning systems, requiring only few adjustments with respect to locating data about students' behaviour, providing notifications about students' actions in a course, and presenting a link to the learning style questionnaire. The architecture has been integrated in a learning system and an adaptivity module has been developed to demonstrate the benefits of dynamic student modelling. This adaptivity module extends the proposed architecture by accessing the information about students' learning styles in the cognitive profile and using this information for providing students with adaptive feedback about their learning styles and how to improve their learning processes considering their learning styles.

Very few negotiable student models have been implemented, and only in relatively simple systems, not integrated into a complex Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). Therefore, it is not clearly known whether negotiable student models pose a significant advantage over simpler open student models. This research implements a basic negotiable student model into a version of a complex and internationally deployed ITS. Subjective evaluation is performed, and shows promising results. Participants felt the negotiable student model was both useful for learning, and enjoyable to use.

In this study, the navigational behaviour of students in an online course within a learning management system was investigated, looking at how students with different learning styles prefer to use and learn in such a course. As a result, several differences in the students' navigation patterns were identified. These findings have several implications for improving adaptivity. First, they showed that students with different learning styles use different strategies to learn and navigate through the course, which can be seen as another argument for providing adaptivity. Second, the findings provided information for extending the adaptive functionality in typical learning management systems. Third, the information about differences in navigational behaviour can contribute towards automatic detection of learning styles, helping in making student modeling approaches more accurate.

With reference this aim, a system, which automatically detects the concepts to be learned by students, has been designed. The developed system uses the statistical language models together with conceptual map modeling as a student model to extract the minimal set of learning concepts within an educational content. In the study, ten corpora have been generated as a learning domain, which consist of two different subjects in mathematics. For each subject, five distinct chapters have been quoted from the books written by various authors. After extracting the candidate concepts from the given content, the system checks to clarify whether these candidates are in a dictionary within postprocessing. The dictionary consists of approximately 9500 technical terms related to the learning domain. The system performance has also been analyzed using Recall, Precision and F-measure scores. The results indicate that the postprocessing step increases precision with a small loss of recall.

Many of those systems have tackled fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics, and computer programming. The change of the student's cognitive behavior over time, however, has not been considered and modeled systematically. Furthermore, the nature of domain knowledge in specific subjects such as orthopedic surgery, in which pragmatic knowledge could play an important role, has also not been taken into account deliberately. We believe that the temporal dimension in modeling the student's knowledge state and cognitive behavior is critical, especially in such domains. In this paper, we propose an approach for student modeling and diagnosis, which is based on a symbiosis between temporal Bayesian networks and fine-grained didactic analysis. The latter may help building a powerful domain knowledge model and the former may help modeling the learner's complex cognitive behavior, so as to be able to provide him or her with relevant feedback during a problem-solving process. To illustrate the application of the approach, we designed and developed several key components of an intelligent learning environment for teaching the concept of sacro-iliac screw fixation in orthopedic surgery, for which we videotaped and analyzed six surgical interventions in a French hospital. A preliminary gold-standard validation suggests that our diagnosis component is able to produce coherent diagnosis with acceptable response time.

They typically present a written-out ideal (didactical) solution for learners to study. Aims: This study used worked examples of patient history taking in physiotherapy that presented a non-didactical solution (i.e., based on actual performance). The effects of model expertise (i.e., worked example based on advanced, third-year student model or expert physiotherapist model) in relation to students' expertise (i.e., first- or second-year) were investigated. Sample: One hundred and thirty-four physiotherapy students (61 first-year and 73 second-year). Methods: Design was 2 × 2 factorial with factors 'Student Expertise' (first-year vs. second-year) and 'Model Expertise' (expert vs. advanced student). Within expertise levels, students were randomly assigned to the Expert Example or the Advanced Student Example condition. All students studied two examples (content depending on their assigned condition) and then completed a retention and test task. They rated their invested mental effort after each example and test task. Results: Second-year students invested less mental effort in studying the examples, and in performing the retention and transfer tasks than first-year students. They also performed better on the retention test, but not on the transfer test. In contrast to our hypothesis, there was no interaction between student expertise and model expertise: all students who had studied the Expert examples performed better on the transfer test than students who had studied Advanced Student Examples. Conclusions: This study suggests that when worked examples are based on actual performance, rather than an ideal procedure, expert models are to be preferred over advanced student models.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=20438662&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Various methods have been employed to teach social accountability, but further research is needed to identify the most effective technique. One plausible option is to incorporate an interprofessional faculty and student model, in collaboration with community partners, to provide a realistic view of societal dilemmas. The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions from students enrolled in physical and occupational therapy programs, and faculty members, through analysis of post experience reflections on a structured community-based service project. Description: This qualitative study explored student and faculty perceptions about self and service capacity following participation in a communitybased project designed to encourage physical activity, nutritional, and behavioral change in children at risk for obesity. Data were collected from survey responses and focus groups utilizing open ended questions about service perspectives. Aggregate data from all participants were analyzed to derive thematic relationships. Outcomes: Results from this study revealed that participation in a community engagement experience had a positive impact in relation to personal perceptions about service and individual commitment to addressing future social concerns. In addition, participants expressed distinct recognition of value to incorporate an interprofessional model of communication and collaboration as a way to instill an internal desire to provide service to others. Discussion: Results from this study suggest that incorporating community-based service activities utilizing an interprofessional model is an effective way to instill the value of recognizing and acting upon situations of social injustice. Interprofessional role modeling was found to be particularly significant to student learning, especially when intentions were to develop a cognitive awareness of professional identity and social obligation.

The purpose of learner models is to drive personalization based on learner and learning characteristics that are considered as important for the learning process, such as cognitive, affective and behavioral variables. Despite the huge amount of theoretical propositions of learner characteristics considered as relevant for learner models, practical payoffs are rather sparse. This study aims to overview the empirical research on the mere value of learner models in the development of adaptive learning environments. The results show that a lot of high-quality studies are situated in a rather shattered research field, building few bridges from theory to practice.

High system interoperability requires that a common framework be defined that represents the functional essence of educational systems. To address this need, we developed a generic model of educational systems that we called Cognitive Ontology of Educational Systems (COES) and we encoded it as functional reference ontology. It generalizes the educational system architecture, taking into account the cognitive perspective. This framework ranges from the usual e-learning systems to complex cognitive and adaptive hypermedia systems. This article describes the part of the COES related to domain knowledge representation and proposes an implementation called Generic Educational Knowledge (GEK). The GEK model is structured in a flexible way that allows the authors to codify instructional and semantic levels as needed. In order to test its feasibility, the model was applied in a distance learning course using two educational-knowledge models, GEK and ADLSCORM, and two educational systems, a traditional Web-Based Adaptive Hypermedia System and a Rich Internet Application with dialog interaction and cognitive monitoring.

The method was validated by way of simulations. In the current work we further evaluate this method and introduce a second, learning gain, analysis method for comparison. These methods were applied to 11 experiment datasets that investigated the effectiveness of various forms of tutorial help in a web-based math tutoring system. We found that the tutorial help chosen by the Bayesian method as having the highest rate of learning agreed with the learning gain analysis in 10 out of 11 of the experiments. An additional simulation study is presented comparing the statistical power of each method given different sample sizes.

In prior work we introduced one approach to this problem: a Bayesian knowledge tracing derived method that could analyze the log data of a tutoring system to determine which items were most effective for learning among a set of items of the same skill. The method was validated by way of simulations. In the current work we further evaluate this method and introduce a second, learning gain, analysis method for comparison. These methods were applied to 11 experiment datasets that investigated the effectiveness of various forms of tutorial help in a web-based math tutoring system. We found that the tutorial help chosen by the Bayesian method as having the highest rate of learning agreed with the learning gain analysis in 10 out of 11 of the experiments. An additional simulation study is presented comparing the statistical power of each method given different sample sizes. The practical impact of this work is an abundance of knowledge about what works that can now be learned from the thousands of experimental designs intrinsic in datasets of tutoring systems that assign items or feedback conditions in an individually-randomized order.

An ITS helps student learn higher order problem solving skills in a particular subject without teacher assistance. Through use of a Student Model, an Expert Module, and a Pedagogical Module, the Fractions Tutor observes how a student tries to solve various problems, breaking each answer into a number of steps which correlate to well defined concepts within the Student Model. Based on a student's proficiency with these concepts, the Pedagogical Module offers reinforcement of the proper problem solving techniques through use of lessons and activities, such as solving for the lowest common denominator and simplifying a fraction. The software was used by a group of 6th graders and a group of 7th graders for 25 minutes, preceded by a five-minute 20-question pretest and followed by an identical posttest used to gauge the students' level of improvement. The experiments yielded statistically significant results showing that both 6th and 7th grade classes get more answers correct on the posttest.

The main objective was to develop an adaptive e-learning system based on individual student's learning style, then to try and assess the effectiveness of the system on the students' learning. From a technical perspective, the system development involved the combination of SQL server 2005, SQL database and Active Server Pages were used to implement the system based on learning styles to present the appropriate subject matter, including the content, Teaching strategies and Electronic Media. The system was organized into 3 models; domain model, learner model and adaptation model. The 3 models interact together to perform adaptively. From an experiment design perspective, experiments involved applying using the system on two cohorts of students and evaluating the impact on learning achievement. Inferential statistics were applied to make inferences from the sample data to more general conditions. Descriptive statistics were applied simply to describe what's going on in the sample data. Results showed that students taught using learning style adaptive system performed significantly better in academic achievement (p<0.05) than students taught the same material without adaptation to learning style. Measuring the effect of providing educational experiences individualized to the learning style of the students is an open research issue: There are many potential influences on any learning achieved other than the adaptive learning system. This paper hopes to make contribution by presenting a case study of a dedicated adaptive educational system and providing guidance and discussion on both development issues and how to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive learning system. First, the adaptation logic, methods and techniques employed in the system, the Teacher Assisting and Subject Adaptive Material (TASAM), are briefly presented. Next, the validity and effectiveness of the system are assessed by means of an empirical evaluation approach, involving experiment with 53 undergraduate students of The 'Arts and Humanities' faculty at the King Abdul-Aziz University in Saudi Arabia. The results obtained (in terms of discusses the Final of the system using two different Arabic speaking groups with different use profiles of the system, performance, efficiency and satisfaction) are analyzed and discussed. This paper covers Test-Retest Reliability of student`s first evaluation survey, Result of Student`s First evaluation Survey and the final evaluation and assessment of the adaptive learning system by students. The findings support the use of learning styles as guideline for adaptation into the adaptive e-learning hypermedia systems. This paper provides discussion and guidance on how to evaluate the impact of adaptive learning systems. The overall results of the experimental study indicate a positive effect of adaptation to learning styles on the learning process.

These models usually include individual characteristics such as the level of knowledge of a given topic, the learning style or the type of personality, the level of participation and so on. However, when the focus is on group activities, these learning environments often use group characteristics, losing sight of the individuals in the groups. Therefore, a student model considering individual characteristics in groups is introduced in this article. This model is built by automatically analysing collaborative behaviour and capturing the context in which it appears. A particular contribution of this approach is focused on a flexible structure of collaboration contexts which are defined at runtime. This approach has been proven in simulated and real environments showing promising results, provided that a given collaborative behaviour is found in at least 20% of the captured actions.

Internet based distance learning presents itself as one opportunity to keep pace with fast changing labour market. As a specific way of organization and conducting of teaching and learning, distance learning is becoming more and more significant. In order to achieve an efficient organization and efficiently implement the education, e-learning systems have to be adjustable to every student. Adaptation of e-learning systems is the most important component of the distance education system and it has to be supported and developed by the Internet platforms which support this form of education. Adaptation of the system enables the student for a simpler and better ways of acquiring of knowledge and skills, as well as the implementation of the overall specialization process. In order for the systems to be adaptable, it is important to create a student model for each student. As the student models are changing it is necessary to build a new system which would allow for saving and continuous updating of the student model with the assistance of a smart card and the Ministry of education's system of monitoring of education and advancement.

The Student Models (SMs) should not only represent the student’s knowledge, but rather they should reflect, as faithfully as possible, the student’s reasoning process. To facilitate this goal, in this article a new approach to student modeling is proposed that benefits from the advantages of Ontological Engineering, advancing in the pursue of a more granular and complete knowledge representation. It’s focused, mainly, on the SM cognitive diagnosis process, and we present a method providing a rich diagnosis about the student’s knowledge state – especially, about the state of learning objectives reached or not. The main goal is to achieve SMs with a good adaptability to the student’s features and a high flexibility for its integration in varied ITSs.

In this context, it is crucial to conduct research that embraces innovation in user sensitive design, or else influential individual user differences may be overlooked. The objective of this paper is to explore the creation of successful e-learning systems that are able to increase users' learning performance and enhance their personal learning experiences. The paper reports two converging and complimentary approaches, namely case studies and experimentation. First, case studies are used to explore the extent to which effective e-learning systems comply with eight specific factors. Of the eight, accessibility, individual differences and student modeling turn out to be the weakest points in current practice. Second, an empirical study investigates the influences of user individual user differences on users' learning outcomes in an e-learning environment. The experiment found that individual differences in motivation to learn and expectations about e-learning significantly impacted users' learning achievements. Third, based on these studies, improvements in research methodology are identified towards greater consideration of user sensitive research issues, thus enabling us to outline improved experimental procedures. Further experiment results should provide us with better insights into the arguments needed to carefully assess benefits of developing and involving a user model in an e-learning application. Consequently, evaluation and justification could now encompass both system performance as well as user performance.

The ability to teach each student based on their individual abilities a major advantage posed by ITS and that is why it is being embraced in this work. This work describes the design of an Intelligent Tutoring System that was tagged Scholastic tutor (St*), which has the individual learning and collaborative problem-solving modules. The individual tutoring module was designed to provide appropriate lessons to individuals based on his/her background knowledge level, interest, and learning style and assimilation rate prior to using the tutoring system. A software agent is used to monitor and process these parameters, arrange the learning topic, and exercises, for each individual. The collaborative problem-based tutoring module was designed to present tutorial problems and provides facilities to assist learners with some useful information and advice for problem solving. This is because the present lecturing methodology which is the conventional teaching methodology provides an interactive classroom setting that promotes the open exchange of ideas and allows for the lecturer to communicate directly with the students but has a great disadvantage of not teaching all the students according to their own learning rate and pace. The intelligent tutor solves this problem by providing individualised learning for each student where they can learn according to their own pace and learning abilities it will provide remedy and advice when learners encounter difficulties during learning session. The classical model of ITS architecture has four main modules; domain model, student model, tutoring model and the user interface model.

An enhanced version, developed for this study, contains an additional phonological code and an improved word selection controller relying on a phoneme-based student model. We investigated the spelling behavior of children by means of learning curves based on log-file data of the previous and the enhanced software version. First, we compared the learning progress of children with dyslexia working either with the previous software (n = 28) or the adapted version (n = 37). Second, we investigated the spelling behavior of children with dyslexia (n = 37) and matched children without dyslexia (n = 25). To gain deeper insight into which factors are relevant for acquiring spelling skills, we analyzed the influence of cognitive abilities, such as attention functions and verbal memory skills, on the learning behavior. All investigations of the learning process are based on learning curve analyses of the collected log-file data. The results evidenced that those children with dyslexia benefit significantly from the additional phonological cue and the corresponding phoneme-based student model. Actually, children with dyslexia improve their spelling skills to the same extent as children without dyslexia and were able to memorize phoneme to grapheme correspondence when given the correct support and adequate training. In addition, children with low attention functions benefit from the structured learning environment. Generally, our data showed that memory sources are supportive cognitive functions for acquiring spelling skills and for using the information cues of a multi-modal learning environment.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=21562919&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

These concepts are also very useful in real life situations such as calculating the amount to save for retirement. This paper details a retirement model that can be built during class to teach TVM. While traditional teaching methods give small pieces of the TVM picture, then exercises to reinforce that partial knowledge, this model incorporates many TVM techniques into one Excel modeling exercise. The model incorporates both TVM functions that are included in Excel and other formulas that must be entered into Excel by the student modeler. Unlike some other articles that focus on how much should be saved annually assuming a constant salary, this exercise focuses on a percentage of income to be saved. The model also addresses an assumed growth factor in the salary and the issue of inflation. This modeling tool is presented to adults in graduate level classes, so it incorporates the fact that they might already have some savings coming into this retirement planning exercise. This method of teaching TVM has several objectives. Primarily, the exercise contributes to the learning of TVM concepts and techniques. It also shows how the equations modeled here can be used to solve retirement planning questions, while contributing to the personal financial literacy of students, and improving model building skills in Excel.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1056321&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Intelligent tutoring has been deployed for well-defined and relatively static educational domains such as algebra and geometry. However, this adaptive approach to computer-based training has yet to come into wider usage for domains that are less well defined or where student-system interactions are less structured, such as during scenario-based simulation and immersive serious games. In order to address how to expand the reach of adaptive training technology to these domains, leading experts in the field present their work in areas such as student modeling, pedagogical strategy, knowledge assessment, natural language processing, and virtual human agents. Several approaches to designing adaptive technology are discussed for both traditional educational settings and professional training domains.

The system is composed of a student model and an adaptation model. It collected students' browsing behaviors to update the student model for unobtrusively identifying student cognitive styles through a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLFF). The MLFF was adopted because of its ability on imprecise or incompletely understood data, ability to generalize and learn from specific examples, ability to be quickly updated with extra parameters, and speed in execution making them ideal for real time applications. The system then adaptively recommended learning content presented with a variety of content and interactive components through the adaptation model based on the student cognitive style identified in the student model. The adaptive web interfaces were designed by investigating the relationships between students' cognitive styles and browsing patterns of content and interactive components. Training of the MLFF and an experiment were conducted to examine the accuracy of identifying students' cognitive styles during browsing with the proposed MLFF and the impact of the proposed adaptive web-based system on students' engagement in learning. The training results of the MLFF showed that the proposed system could identify students' cognitive styles with high accuracy and the temporal effects should be considered while identifying students' cognitive styles during browsing. Two factors, the acknowledgment of students' cognitive styles while browsing and the existence of adaptive web interfaces, were used to assign three classes of college freshmen into three groups. The experimental results revealed that the proposed system could have significant impacts on temporal effects on students' engagement in learning, not only for students with cognitive styles known before browsing, but also for students with cognitive styles identified during browsing. The results provide evidence of the effectiveness of the adaptive web-based learning system with students' cognitive styles dynamically identified during browsing, thus validating the research purposes of this study.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eft&AN=527588452&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

There are many approaches and technologies for student modeling, but choosing the right one depends on intended functionalities of an intelligent system that the student model is going to be used in. Those functionalities often determine the kinds of information that the student model should contain. The student model used in DEPTHS is a result of combining two widely known modeling approaches, namely, stereotype and overlay modeling. The model is domain independent and can be easily applied in other learning domains as well. To keep student model update during the learning process, DEPTHS makes use of a knowledge assessment method based on fuzzy rules (i.e., a combination of production rules and fuzzy logics). The evaluation of DEPTHS performed with the aim of assessing the system’s overall effectiveness and the accuracy of its student model, indicated several advantages of the DEPTHS system over the traditional approach to learning design patterns, and encouraged us to move on further with this research.

The learner model presented in our earlier work was partitioned into smaller elements in the form of learner profiles, which collectively represent the entire learning process. This paper presents an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for delivering adapted learning content to mobile learners. The ANFIS model was designed using trial and error based on various experiments. This study was conducted to illustrate that ANFIS is effective with hybrid learning, for the adaptation of learning content according to learners' needs. Study results show that ANFIS has been successfully implemented for learning content adaptation within different learning context scenarios. The performance of the ANFIS model was evaluated using standard error measurements which revealed the optimal setting necessary for better predictability. The MATLAB simulation results indicate that the performance of the ANFIS approach is valuable and easy to implement. The study results are based on analysis of different model settings; they confirm that the m-learning application is functional. However, it should be noted that an increase in the number of inputs being considered by the model will increase the system response time, and hence the delay for the mobile learner.

LS is referred here as a learning path consisting of a set of learning objects (LOs). Selection of LS is considered as recommendations of choosing and combining the set of LOs in accordance with learner's preferences. This research issue is widely discussed in the eLearning context. When talking about adaptive learning, the selection of LOs is very important. LS can be selected according to learner's preferences by applying artificial intelligence techniques, e.g. a swarm intelligence model. Based on the overview of literature, we have noticed that so far the selection of LS was taken as a static object by using this technique, meanwhile in the real world LS is a dynamic object, and it can be modified during the learner learning process by inserting, deleting, and editing LOs. The paper deals with application of a modified and optimized algorithm as a dynamic optimization problem in the eLearning context. While learners act in the learning environment, they act according to their LSs. Information about learners' behaviour can be gathered and kept in the so-called ""pheromones"", which can be used later as recommendations to other learners. If we modify and/or change some LOs in LS, we should rearrange the alignment of new and old LOs and reallocate pheromones in order to achieve learner effective learning recommendations. In order to solve this problem, a new method, based on the ant colony optimization algorithm and adaptation of the solution to the changing optimum, is proposed. A simulation process with a dynamic change of LS, when new LOs are inserted, was chosen to verify the proposed method. The results reveal that the proposed method, based on a swarm intelligence approach, is suitable for selecting dynamic LS according to learners' preferences. The developed learner model is based on their learning styles (LSt). The set of the analysed LSts is based on the Honey and Mumford typology. Several approaches can be used to identify a student's LSt, including questionnaires and different soft computing techniques. This paper contributes with new developments: 1) an approach of dynamic LS selection, based on a swarm intelligence, and 2) a modified ant colony optimization algorithm for LS selection. The elaborated approach for LS selection can effectively assist in learners learning by helping them to reach most suitable LOs according to their LSts. Also, the approach is important for tutors by helping them to monitor, refine and improve eLearning modules and courses.

Among these individual difference variables, the empirical evidence regarding the pedagogical value of learning styles has been questioned, but the research on the issue continues. Recent developments in Web-based implementations have led scholars to reconsider the learning style research in adaptive systems. The current study involved a content analysis of recent studies on adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) which addressed learning styles. After an extensive search on electronic databases, seventy studies were selected and exposed to a document analysis. Study features were classified under several themes such as the research purposes, methodology, features of adaptive interventions and student modeling, and findings. The analysis revealed that the majority of studies proposed a framework or model for adaptivity whereas few studies addressed the effectiveness of learning style-based AEH. Scales were used for learning style identification more than automatic student modeling. One third of the studies provided a framework without empirical evaluation with students. Findings on concrete learning outcomes were not strong enough; however, several studies revealed that suggested models influenced student satisfaction and success. Current trends, potential research gaps and implications were discussed.

Although the mechanisms of effective adaptive instruction are unraveled systematically, little is known about the relative effect of learners' perceptions of adaptivity in adaptive learning environments. As previous research has demonstrated that the learners' view towards a learning environment strongly influences their learning outcomes and learning process, it can be discussed whether program-defined adaptivity is not only effective because of the underlying learner models, but also because the adaptivity is perceived and experienced as such by the learners. In this study, we apply the cognitive mediational paradigm and hypothesize that perceptions of adaptivity mediate the relation between adaptive instruction and learners' motivations and learning outcomes. The results do not fully support the claim of the cognitive mediational paradigm. Both adaptivity and perceptions were related to motivation, but learners' perceptions did not act as a mediating variable.

The aim is to enhance the learning of students by the self-adaptation of a Web-based educational system (WBES). The adaptive system’s behavior is achieved as a result of the decisions made by a student model (SM). The decision reveals the lecture option most suitable to teach a concept according to the student’s profile. Thus, the lecture content is authored from different view points (e.g. learning theory, type of media, complexity level, and user-system interaction degree). The purpose is to tailor several educational options to teach a given concept. Thereby, the SM elicits psychological attributes of the student to describe subjective traits, such as: cognitive, personality, and learning preferences. It also depicts pedagogical properties of the available lecture’s options. Moreover, the SM dynamically builds a cognitive map (CM) to set fuzzy-causal relationships among the lecture’s option properties and the student’s attributes. Based on a fuzzy-causal engine, the SM predicts the bias that a lecture’s option exerts on the student’s apprenticeship. The conceptual, theoretical, and formal grounds of the approach were tested by a computer implementation of the SM and an experiment. As a result of a field trial, we found that: the average learning acquired by an experimental group of volunteers that used this approach was 17% higher than the average apprenticeship of another equivalent control group, whose lectures were randomly chosen. Thus we conclude that: learning is better stimulated when the delivered lectures account a student’s profile than when they ignore it.

Since the publication of Holec's book, Autonomy and Foreign Language Learning (1981), autonomy in language learning has been a significant issue for discussion in relation to language learning practices and language teaching principles. Many ESL researchers have turned their attention to learner autonomy in classroom settings; however, learner autonomy in the Iranian context within self-access settings, classroom settings, and school curriculum has not been adequately addressed in the literature. To fill the research gap mentioned above, the present study aims to determine: 1. if Betts's Autonomous Learner Model (Betts & Kercher, 1999) has any significant effect in terms of students' self-directed learning readiness, and 2. if Betts's Autonomous Learner Model has any significant effect on students' English language proficiency. Adopting a quasi-experimental design, the study involved a comparison between the experimental and the control group. Two instruments were used: Gugliemino's (1977) Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS); and standardized TOEFL test. 30 students (group A) were taught English based on a pedagogical model, which blended Betts's ALM with classroom instruction and 30 students (group B) were taught through a traditional teacher-directed method. Finally, after six months of treatment, TOEFL test and SDLRS test were administered as the post-test and the results were analyzed by means of SPSS software. The results showed that ALM can work with Iranian students as evidenced by generally average performance on SDLRS and TOEFL post-tests.

The activities are supported by interactive PDF documents which explain the fundamental concepts, methods and reasoning processes using text, images and embedded movies, and include free space for multimedia enriched student modelling reports and teacher feedback. To illustrate, an example from physics implemented in the Modellus environment and tested in undergraduate university general physics and biophysics courses is discussed.

Our student model represents the learner’s knowledge through an overlay model and uses a fuzzy logic technique in order to define and update the student’s knowledge level of each domain concept, each time that s/he interacts with the e-learning system. Evaluation of the student model of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) is an aspect for which there are not clear guidelines to be provided by literature. Therefore, we choose to use two well-known evaluation methods for the evaluation of our fuzzy student model, in order to design an accurate and correct evaluation methodology. These evaluation models are: the Kirkpatrick’s model and the layered evaluation method. Our system was used by the students of a postgraduate program in the field of Informatics in the University of Piraeus, in order to learn how to program in the programming language C. The results of the evaluation were very encouraging.

This generic Bayesian student model had been previously evaluated with simulated students, but a real application was still missing. In the work presented here, we have used the GBSM to define Bayesian Student Models (BSMs) for a concrete domain: first degree equations. In order to test the diagnosis capabilities of such BSMs, an evaluation with 152 students has been performed. Each of the 152 students took both a computerized test within PMatE and a written exam, both of them designed to measure students'' knowledge in 12 concepts related to first degree equations. The written exam was graded by three experts. Then two BSMs were developed, one for the computer test and another one for the written exam. These BSMs were used to obtain estimations of student's knowledge on the same 12 concepts, and the inter-rater agreement among the different measures was computed. Results show a high degree of agreement among the scores given by the experts and also among the diagnosis provided by the BSM in the written exam and expert's average, but a low degree of agreement among the diagnosis provided by the BSM in the computer test and expert's average.

It provides full support for the management of the usual teaching tasks in a traditional school: Student and teacher registration, creation and management of classes and test papers, individualized assignment of exercises, intelligent step by step guidance in solving exercises, student interaction recording, skill mastery statistics and student assessment. The intelligence of the system lies in its Algebra Tutor, a model-tracing tutor developed within the MATHESIS project, that teaches a breadth of 16 top-level math skills (algebraic operations): monomial multiplication, division and power, monomial-polynomial and polynomial-polynomial multiplication, parentheses elimination, collect like terms, identities (square of sum and difference, product of sum by difference, cube of sum and difference), factoring (common factor, term grouping, identities, quadratic form). These skills are further decomposed in simpler ones giving a deep domain expertise model of 104 primitive skills. The tutor has two novel features: a) it exhibits ""intelligent task recognition"" by identifying all skills present in any expression through intelligent parsing, and b) for each identified skill, the tutor traces all the sub-skills, a feature we call ""deep model tracing."" Furthermore, based on these features, the tutor achieves ""broad knowledge monitoring"" by recording student performance for all skills present in any expression. Forty teachers who evaluated the system in a 3-hours workshop appreciated the fine-grained step-by-step guidance of the student, the equally fine grained student model created by the tutor and its ability to tutor any exercise that contains the aforementioned math skills. The system was also used in a real junior high school classroom with 20 students for three months. Evaluation of the students' performance in the domain of factoring gave positive learning results.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1190019&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

These representational systems reveal modelers' interpretations of the relative importance of various real-world aspects. Purpose This paper illustrates how interpretations of student teams' solution models (i.e., their representational systems) to a particular problem can be used to inform educational decisions. Design/Method First-year engineering teams' iterative solution models to the Travel Mode Choice Model-Eliciting Activity (MEA) were interpreted for the purpose of identifying patterns within and across teams' responses. This MEA requires the creation of a model for a client who wants to predict the mode of transportation an individual will likely take to a college campus. Teams were provided with the client's needs and sample data concerning individuals' actual travel mode and travel time, cost, and convenience for various travel modes (walk, bus, or drive). Results Student teams were required to submit their intermediate and final model descriptions in narrative form. Systematic study of their models resulted in identification of four different types of models. Patterns within and across model types were then used to suggest changes to the instructional system. Conclusion When instructors study student models as representations of their interpretation of a real-world problem situation, insights gained can lead to practical proposals for improving instruction with authentic open-ended problems including revisions to tasks, implementation strategies, formative assessment strategies, and course content.

This context-dependency might be related to the focus of ecosystem instruction. Most commonly, the components are the first to be introduced and are given the greatest attention in the teaching of ecological and other biological systems. Here, we test the hypothesis that process-centered understanding of ecosystems, as opposed to structured-centered understanding, can facilitate students' ability to transfer ecosystem concepts to new and novel ecosystems. We found that teachers who taught ecosystem processes more generally were associated with greater variation in student models, indicating a greater range of ideas being represented among the students.

Thus, the game flow can be optimized to increase efficiency and effectiveness of gaming and learning in parallel. In the field of gaming still the Bartle model is commonly used due to its simplicity and good mapping to game scenarios, for learning the Learning Style Inventory from Kolb or Index of Learning Styles by Felder and Silverman are well known. For personality traits the NEO-FFI (Big5) model is widely accepted. When designing games it is always a challenge to assess one player's profile characteristics properly in all three models (player/learner/personality). Still, it is valuable to collect information to refine the models continuously to adapt the game experience precisely to a player's models. To reduce the effort and amount of dimensions and questionnaires a player might have to fill out, we proved the hypothesis that both, Learning Style Inventory and Bartle Player Types could be predicted by knowing the personality traits based on NEO-FFI. Thus we investigated the statistical correlations among the models by collecting answers to the questionnaires of Bartle Test, Kolb LSI 3.1 and BFI-K (short version of NEO-FFI). The study was conducted in spring 2012 with six school classes of grade 9 (12-14year old students) in two different secondary schools in Germany. 72 students participated in the study which was offered optionally after the use of a game-based learning tool for peer learning. We present the results, statistics and correlations among the models as well as the interdependencies with the student's level of proficiency and their social connectedness. In conclusion, the evaluation proved the independency of the models and the validity of the dimensions. Still, especially for all of the playing style preferences of Bartle's model significant correlations with some of the analyzed other questionnaire items could be found. As no predictions of learning style preferences is possible on the basis of this studies data, the final recommendation for the development of game-based learning application concludes that separate modeling for the adaptation game flow (playing) and learn flow (learning) is still necessary.

In the intervention, teachers received written curriculum materials about mathematical modeling. The concept underlying the materials was based on constructivist ideas and findings from mathematics education. Teacher beliefs about mathematics, learning and self-efficacy were expected to have a major impact on their classroom practices. We therefore assessed teacher beliefs about the usefulness of mathematics, learning (constructivist and socio-constructivist beliefs) and teacher self-efficacy when teaching modeling (teacher or class level variable). The student level variables assessed were modeling competence and other individual factors, such as basic mathematical skills and cognitive abilities. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured in a pre-post control group design using multilevel structural equation modeling. The results showed no direct effect of the intervention on student modeling competence. However, they did reveal that the intervention had a significant effect on teacher beliefs about learning (constructivist and socio-constructivist view) and an effect of these teacher beliefs about learning on student modeling competence. Further, the results showed that students' gains in modeling competence is not only mediated by teacher beliefs, but also influenced by individual factors.

Our approach is a variant of student modeling using the computer tutoring concept of knowledge tracing. Knowledge tracing involves representing the knowledge required to master a domain, and, from traces of online user behavior, diagnosing user knowledge states as a profile over those elements. The user model is induced from documents tagged by an expert in a social tagging system. Tags identified with 'expertise' in a domain can be used to identify a corpus of domain documents. That corpus can be fed to an automated process that distills a topic model representation characteristic of the domain. As a learner navigates and reads online material, inferences can be made about the degree to which topics in the target domain have been learned.

The general framework of evidence-centered assessment design is used to describe PSLEs in terms of assessment concepts, and to identify similarities between the process of assessment design and of PSLE design. We use a recently developed PSLE, the ProNIFA system, to illustrate the concepts of student model, evidence model, and task model, concepts that provide for a close link between problem solving teaching software and assessment concepts. We also introduce ProNIFA because it uses a mathematical method developed in psychometric test theory—Competency-based Knowledge Space Theory (CbKST)—for building a student model based on observations on students'' problem solving performance. The experiences made with methods such as CbKST lead us to the conclusion that the time has come to more frequently integrate assessment components into PSLEs, and to use problem solving and simulation environments as part of assessment environments. This will contribute to making assessment more authentic and less obtrusive, and making PSLEs more relevant in formal educational settings.

In this context, this paper presents an automatic, dynamic and probabilistic approach for modeling students learning styles based on reinforcement learning. Three different strategies for updating the student model are proposed and tested through experiments. The results obtained are analyzed, indicating the most effective strategy. Experiments have shown that our approach is able to automatically detect and precisely adjust students’ learning styles, based on the non-deterministic and non-stationary aspects of learning styles. Because of the probabilistic and dynamic aspects enclosed in automatic detection of learning styles, our approach gradually and constantly adjusts the student model, taking into account students’ performances, obtaining a fine-tuned student model.

Therefore, an optimal pedagogical path for one does not necessarily fit the other. Thus, providing an interactive environment tailored to the learner's needs is one of the most important goals of e-learning environments. In our proposal, we make the adaptation of learning our main objective. Our theoretical framework stems from the fact that HCI is a combination of cognitive, behavioral and computer sciences. On the cognitive and behavioural scope, we have opted for adaptive formative assessment so as to identify the learner's competence level and, thereon, to guide the learner to reach the educationally drawn output profile. The aforementioned assessment highlights the learner's real time competence. The latter and the learner's prior knowledge are pivotal elements in adapting the learning process. On the computing scope, this process is carried out via an e-learning system in which the proposed assessment is implemented through Services Oriented Architecture (SOA). In this paper, it would be prominent to individualize the learning path by adopting formative assessment by proposing an adaptive test which offers a selection of optimal items in a sequence taking into account the profile and the progress of the learner. To implement the proposed system, first, we modelled learner and items according to competency based approach (CBA). Then, modelled the formative assessment in an adaptive approach using the Item response theory (IRT), this will provide a series of consecutively selected items. The answer to an item determines the selection of the next one taking into account the previous responses and performances recorded in the learner model.

Regardless of their necessity and benefit, science seems to be difficult for some students, as a result of the mathematical representations and problem solving used in scientific inquiry. In this regard, several studies have attributed students' decreasing interest in science to the presence of these mathematical representations. In order to better understand student learning difficulties caused by mathematical components, the current study investigates student understanding of a familiar science concept and its mathematical component (pH value and logarithms). Student responses to a questionnaire and a follow-up interview were examined in detail. ""Measure"" and ""concentration"" were key criteria for students' understanding of pH values. In addition, only a few students understood logarithms on a meaningful level. According to students' understanding of scientific phenomena and mathematical structures, five different student models and the critical features of each type were identified. Further analysis revealed the existence of three domains that characterize these five types: object, operation, and function.

Personalized and social learning have been suggested as potential ways to address these problems. Our work presented in this paper combines the ideas of personalized and social learning in the context of educational hypermedia. We introduce Progressor, an innovative Web-based tool based on the concepts of social navigation and open student modeling that helps students to find the most relevant resources in a large collection of parameterized self-assessment questions on Java programming. We have evaluated Progressor in a semester-long classroom study, the results of which are presented in this paper. The study confirmed the impact of personalized social navigation support provided by the system in the target context. The interface encouraged students to explore more topics attempting more questions and achieving higher success rates in answering them. A deeper analysis of the social navigation support mechanism revealed that the top students successfully led the way to discovering most relevant resources by creating clear pathways for weaker students.

Furthermore, Vygotskij s educational mode! includes a strong bent towards social and collaborative learning. The joint answer to these two trends can be concretely implemented through a tight integration between personalized learning paths and collaborative learning activities. Along this line, the authors designed the combination of the functions of two pre-existing prototypes of web-based systems, to investigate how the above integration can merge adaptive and social e-learning. LECOMPS is a web-based e-learning environment for the automated construction of adaptive learning paths. SOCIALX is a web-based system for shared e-learning activities, which implements a reputation system to provide feedback to its participants. The authors propose a two-way tunneling strategy to integrate the above prototypes. The result is twofold: on the one hand the use of the student model supported by LECOMPS in an adaptive e-learning course is extended to support choosing exercise activities delivered through SOCIALX: on the other hand the reputation and the skills gained during social-collaborative activities are used to update the student model. Under the social perspective induced by the integration, the authors present a mapping between the student model and the definition of Vygotskij's A utonomous Problem Solving and Proximal Development regions, with the aim to provide the learner with better guidance, especially in the selection of available social learning activities.

This study examines a two student to one faculty ATOM teaching model. Materials and Methods: We randomly assigned 16 residents to four experienced ATOM faculty members. Half started with the one-student model and the other half with the two-student model and then switched using the same faculty. Students and faculty completed forms on the educational value of the two models (1 = very poor; 2 = poor; 3 = average; 4 = good; and 5 = excellent) and identified educational preferences and recommendations. Results: We assigned educational values for the 13 procedures as follows: All faculty rated the one-student model as excellent; six members rated the two-student model as excellent, and seven as good. Students rated 50%-75% as excellent and 12%-44% as good for the two-student model, and 56%-81% as excellent and 12%-44% as good for the one-student model. Given resource constraints, all faculty and 88% of students preferred the two-student model. With no resource constraints, 75% of students and 50% of faculty chose the two-student model. All faculty and students rated both models ""acceptable."" Overall, 81% of students and 50% of faculty rated the two-student model better. All faculty members recommended that the models be optional; 94% of students recommended that they be either optional (50%) or a two-student model (44%). Performing or assisting on each procedure twice was considered an advantage of the two-student model. Conclusions: The two-student teaching model was acceptable and generally preferred in this study. With appropriately trained faculty and students, the two-student model is feasible and should result in less animal usage and possibly wider promulgation. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The review aims at answering three basic questions on student modeling: what to model, how and why. The prevailing student modeling approaches that have been used in the past 10years are described, the aspects of students’ characteristics that were taken into consideration are presented and how a student model can be used in order to provide adaptivity and personalisation in computer-based educational software is highlighted. This paper aims to provide important information to researchers, educators and software developers of computer-based educational software ranging from e-learning and mobile learning systems to educational games including stand alone educational applications and intelligent tutoring systems. In addition, this paper can be used as a guide for making decisions about the techniques that should be adopted when designing a student model for an adaptive tutoring system. One significant conclusion is that the most preferred technique for representing the student’s mastery of knowledge is the overlay approach. Also, stereotyping seems to be ideal for modeling students’ learning styles and preferences. Furthermore, affective student modeling has had a rapid growth over the past years, while it has been noticed an increase in the adoption of fuzzy techniques and Bayesian networks in order to deal the uncertainty of student modeling.

This paper describes an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that focuses on this stage of the problem solving process. On the one hand, a domain specific inference engine and a knowledge representation mechanism are proposed. These are based on a description language based on hypergraphs, and the idea of using conceptual schemes to represent the student’s knowledge. As a result, the system is able to simultaneously: (a) represent all potential algebraic solutions to a given word problem; (b) keep track of the student’s actions; (c) univocally determine the current state of the resolution process; (d) build a student model; and (e) provide adaptive automatic remediation. On the other hand, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been designed to force the student to follow the sequence of steps described in the Cartesian method. The ITS has been evaluated in an educational environment. The results show significant gains for the experimental group and hence support the use of the ITS in practice.

To achieve this goal, a model of the student has been proposed, whose considered outputs are the performance and a participation index that measures the activity level of the student in the class. The controller is based on fuzzy logic and uses the predictions of the model to anticipate the student's state. An important issue that has been taken into account is the limited time to identify the dynamics of the student learning before the course ends. This limitation has been treated through a three-stage process. It is important to remark that this work is not focused on obtaining a complete student model, but on getting useful information for the detection of trends in the teaching–learning process. Preliminary results on a real course are presented to attest the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.

Our method is called PeRSIVA and is a combination of the well-known evaluation method of Kirkpatrick and the layered evaluation framework. These well-known and commonly used evaluation techniques have been selected in order to design an accurate and correct evaluation methodology, since there are no clear guidelines in the literature for the evaluation of the student model of an adaptive tutoring system. Furthermore, PeRSIVA method was used to evaluate the hybrid student model, which combines an overlay model with stereotypes and fuzzy logic techniques, of an e-learning system. Particularly, PeRSIVA assesses the results of student modeling in students' satisfaction, performance, progress, behavior and state, as well as the validity of the conclusions drawn by the student model and the validity of the adaptation decision making. The e-learning system was used by the students of a postgraduate program in the field of informatics in the University of Piraeus and the evaluation results demonstrated learning improvements in students and adaptation success to students' needs.

In the case of migratory insertion of CO into the Mn-CH3 bond of [Mn(CH3)(CO)5], semiempirical calculations (PM3) are used to evaluate the concerted mechanism of methyl migration, followed by coordination of CO. The three-centered transition state is determined along with the activation energy, calculated to be 131 kJ/mol. The 16-electron intermediate [Mn(C(O)CH3)(CO)4] is suggested to display an agostic Mn-H interaction as has been postulated previously. The exercise is appropriate as a take-home assignment in a course on inorganic or organometallic chemistry.

Many school nurses have less confidence in managing some neurological conditions, thus identifying a need for continuing education. Education around a broad spectrum of common child neurology conditions can help school nurses blend educational, medical, and health services action plans. A curriculum was developed based upon the Child Neurology Telephone Encounter Guides (Sprague-McRae, Rosenblum, & Morrison, 2009). The curriculum uses the Child Neurology Process-Oriented Triage conceptual framework (Rosenblum & Sprague-McRae, 2009) and the Healthy Learner Model (Erickson, Splett, Mullett, & Heiman, 2006) to promote and maintain student health.

Software development relies on many different programming languages and tools, ranging from procedural to object-oriented and query languages; an individual learning a new language may already know a range of other languages, or may know no other languages at all. Given the variety of backgrounds of prospective learners of programming, developing learning environments for all of them is not easy. In the light of these problems, this work has focused on the development of an original integrated e-training environment for programming and the language C, incorporating a student model responsible for identifying and updating the student's knowledge level, which takes into account each individual user's pace of learning. The system can adapt dynamically to each individual learner's needs by scheduling the sequence of learning lessons on the fly.

It is an efficient approach that can be easily applied inside an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). Even with these characteristics, building new ITSs requires carefully designing the domain model to be taught because different sources of errors could affect the efficiency of the system. In this paper a novel mechanism for studying the quality of the elements in the domain model of CBM systems is presented. This mechanism combines CBM with the Item Response Theory (IRT), a data-driven technique for automatic assessment. The goal is to improve the quality of the elements that are used in problem solving environments for assessment or instruction. In this paper we propose a set of statistical techniques, i.e., the analysis of the point-biserial correlation, the Cronbach’s alpha and the information function, to explore the quality of constraints. Two different tools have been used to test this approach: a problem solving environment designed to assess students in project investment analysis; and an independent component that performs assessments using CBM and IRT. Results suggest that the three methods produce consistent diagnosis and may be complementary in some cases. In the experiments we have carried out they were able to detect faulty, bad and good quality constraints.

It has been shown that different pedagogical strategies promote robust learning to different degrees. However, the student modeling methods embedded within intelligent tutoring systems remain focused on assessing basic skill learning rather than robust learning. Recent work has proposed models, developed using educational data mining, that infer whether students are acquiring learning that transfers to related skills, and prepares the student for future learning (PFL). In this earlier work, evidence was presented that these models achieve superior prediction of robust learning to what can be achieved by traditional methods for student modeling. However, using these models to drive intervention by educational software depends on evidence that these models remain effective within new populations. To this end, we analyze the degree to which these detectors remain accurate for an entirely new population of high school students. We find limited evidence of degradation for transfer. More degradation is seen for PFL. This degradation appears to occur in part because it is generally more difficult to infer this construct within the new population.

Cryosurgery is the destruction of undesired tissue by freezing. Minimally invasive cryosurgery is performed by strategically placing an array of cryoprobes within a pre-specified target region. In prostate cryosurgery, the target region for destruction can be a portion of or the entire gland. A key to cryosurgery success is optimal selection and layout of cryoprobes, which maximizes destruction to the target region while minimizing cryoinjury to surrounding healthy tissues. Currently, selection of cryoprobe type, layout, sequence of operation, and procedure duration is based on the cryosurgeon’s personal experience and accepted practices. Suboptimal cryosurgery protocols may leave untreated areas in the target region, lead to cryoinjury of healthy surrounding tissues, increase the duration of the surgical procedure, and increase the likelihood of post-cryosurgery complications—all of which affect the quality and cost of medical treatment. An ITS guides the student through a problem-solving process by providing instruction and tailored feedback promptly. The cryosurgery ITS presents problems, strategically broken down into smaller steps, that are consistent with clinical practice and pedagogical rational. The ITS proposed in the current study focuses on determining cryoprobe layout, given an overall number of cryoprobes and their operational parameters. Optimal (expert) planning is determined by previously developed planning algorithms, with the trainee attempting to generate a layout that (1) matches the expert layout, with a predefined tolerance, or (2) generates a defect value lower than the expert defect; a defect is defined as either external tissue to the target area that was simulated to be cryoinjured, or internal tissue that was simulated to be uninjured. Key to ITS success is a set of rules and constraints used to evaluate a student’s solution, such as: (1) minimum distance from the urethra; (2) minimum distance from the prostate surface; (3) active cooling surface of a probe included within the gland; and (4) minimum probe layout defect value. ITS effectiveness is measured by evaluating students’ learning gains with increased practice. This study demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a fully-functioning cryosurgery ITS. The cryosurgery ITS prototype is composed of four primary components: a domain model, a student model, a tutor, and a problem interface. In order to establish an expert solution and to evaluate the training progress, the domain model uses: cryoprobe planning algorithms, the simulator, and a set of cryosurgery rules and constraints. The student model uses various performance metrics to map the student’s current knowledge. The tutor provides instruction and returns feedback to the student. The ITS interface provides a realistic problem-solving environment. The ITS integrates previously developed building blocks: a cryosurgery simulator, planning algorithms, and visualization tools. The ITS prototype was developed using Matlab. Source of funding: This study was supported by Award Number R01CA134261 from the National Cancer Institute.

Adaptive learning is an important research topic in the field of web-based systems as there are no fixed learning paths which are appropriate for all learners. However, most studies in this field have only focused on learning styles and habits of learners. Far too little attention has been paid on understanding the ability of learners. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore adaptation in the field of e-learning systems. Many researchers are adopting semantic web technologies to find new ways for designing adaptive learning systems based on describing knowledge using ontological models. Ontologies have the potential to design content and learner models required to create adaptive e-learning systems based on various characteristics of learners. The aim of this paper is to present an ontology-based approach to develop adaptive e-learning system based on the design of semantic content, learner and domain models to tailor the teaching process for individual learner's needs. The proposed new adaptive e-learning has the ability to support personalization based on learner's ability, learning style, preferences and levels of knowledge. In our approach the ontological user profile is updated based on achieved learner's abilities.

Students were first informed about the theoretical background of system dynamics approach, and then some applications were conducted using sample scenarios to show how to model a system with the Stella program. This experimental study lasted one hour for 14 weeks. For the last 8 weeks, students chose one of the previously determined topics and worked on developing a model based on system dynamics using the Stella program. Recordings of the models students had developed and interviews conducted with them were analyzed based on five criteria (using the correct concepts in the model, determining and using the variables, determining the relationship between the variables, locating numerical parameters, and creating and interpreting graphs). In addition, semiconstructed interviews and records by the observing teacher were analyzed and evaluated in relation to the models students had developed. Analytical results revealed that students had difficulty in determining the stock and flow in a system, could not easily perceive the system as a whole, and were unable correctly to form a relationship among various aspects of the system.

One of the sub-projects of this 5-year national research program is to design and develop context-aware mobile learning services. The research team of the sub-project applied narrative theory to design a location based Context-Aware Mobile Role Playing Game (CAM-RPG) in order to give students feeling of living in the game world and role playing, exploring the game world, completing the quests, and learning things. A pilot study was then conducted to see how the two game features--context-awareness and story generation--influence students' attitude towards the use of the mobile educational game.

Thus, the game flow can be optimized to increase efficiency and effectiveness of gaming and learning in parallel. In the field of gaming still the Bartle model is commonly used due to its simplicity and good mapping to game scenarios, for learning the Learning Style Inventory from Kolb or Index of Learning Styles by Felder and Silverman are well known. For personality traits the NEO-FFI (Big5) model is widely accepted. When designing games, it is always a challenge to assess one player's profile characteristics properly in all three models (player/learner/personality). To reduce the effort and amount of dimensions and questionnaires a player might have to fill out, we proved the hypothesis that both, Learning Style Inventory and Bartle Player Types could be predicted by knowing the personality traits based on NEO-FFI. Thus we investigated the statistical correlations among the models by collecting answers to the questionnaires of Bartle Test, Kolb LSI 3.1 and BFI-K (short version of NEO-FFI). A study was conducted in spring 2012 with six school classes of grade 9 (12-14 year old students) in two different secondary schools in Germany. 74 students participated in the study which was offered optionally after the use of a game-based learning tool for peer learning. We present the results statistics and correlations among the models as well as the interdependencies with the student's level of proficiency and their social connectedness. In conclusion, the evaluation (correlation and regression analyses) proved the independency of the models and the validity of the dimensions. Still, especially for all of the playing style preferences of Bartle's model significant correlations with some of the analyzed other questionnaire items could be found. As no predictions of learning style preferences is possible on the basis of this studies data, the final recommendation for the development of game-based learning application concludes that separate modeling for the adaptation game flow (playing) and learn flow (learning) is still necessary.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1111260&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Learning analytics is an evolving discipline with capability for educational data analysis that could enable better understanding of learning process, and therefore mitigate these challenges. The outcome from such data analysis will be dependent on the range, type, and quality of available data and the type of analysis performed. This study reviewed factors that could be used to predict academic performance, but which are currently not systematically measured in tertiary education. It focused on psychometric factors of ability, personality, motivation, and learning strategies. Their respective relationships with academic performance are enumerated and discussed. A case is made for their increased use in learning analytics to enhance the performance of existing student models. It is noted that lack of independence, linear additivity, and constant variance in the relationships between psychometric factors and academic performance suggests increasing relevance of data mining techniques, which could be used to provide useful insights on the role of such factors in the modelling of learning process.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1127032&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Bauer begins his remarks by noting that the Focus article explores a key part of evidence-centered design (ECD)--6 different but nonexclusive roles that task model variables can have and their function within an overall assessment design. The authors of the Focus article provide examples of these roles for more-conventional tasks (math word problems) and for a game-based formative assessment, ""Newton's Playground."" While the Focus article emphasizes structure--the roles of these variables and the relation of these variables to the rest of the assessment design, Bauer's commentary addresses aspects of ECD that are complementary to the article, specifically aspects of process (How does one create a design involving task model variables? What is the dynamic relation between the student-model, evidence-model, and task-model variables as they are developed and revised?). While the structures described in Almond et al. provide the ""what"" of evidence-centered assessment design, Bauer describes the intent of this commentary as more of a discussion about the design process itself-that is, the ""how"" that leads to these useful structures.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1033230&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

These critics have decried the lack of strategic skills and the focus on declarative knowledge associated with specific CAD packages. This work will discuss the most recent findings of a three year iterative investigation examining the role of contextual exercises on CAD modeling procedure and the manifestation of adaptive expertise. The effects of a varying number of contextual exercises incorporated in regular instruction throughout a semester will be examined. Contextual exercises consist of students modeling a component that they have a personal connection to, as opposed to a stylized example from the textbook. Modeling performance on a standard assessment is compared for the various groups as is performance on an end of the semester exercise. This work compares the results of student performance on the standard assessment based on whether students received no, one, or four contextual exercises prior to the assessment. Student performance on an end of the semester exercise that is either stylized or contextual in nature is also examined. Student interviews and coding are used to examine the manifestation of adaptive expertise among those various groups. Statistical analyses are used to evaluate differences among the groups. Interview data showed that there was a slightly greater manifestation of behaviors associated with adaptive expertise in the single contextual self-guided exercise group as compared to those students that used a stylized self-guided exercise. However these differences were of limited statistical significance. The implementation of four contextual exercises showed no increase in the manifestation of adaptive expertise behaviors. In both cases, the implementation of contextual exercises did not result in improved performance on the standard assessment. Limitations of the work and possible causes for some of the unexpected results are detailed.

One of the sub-projects of this 5-year national research program is to design and develop context-aware mobile learning services. The research team of the sub-project applied narrative theory to design a location based Context-Aware Mobile Role Playing Game (CAM-RPG) in order to give students feeling of living in the game world and role playing, exploring the game world, completing the quests, and learning things. A pilot study was then conducted to see how the two game features -- context-awareness and story generation -- influence students' attitude towards the use of the mobile educational game. The research findings suggest that the story generated in CAM-RPG positively influences users' attitude towards game use and increases users' perceived game usefulness.

When multiple representations are presented across consecutive problems, we have to decide in what sequence to present them. Prior research has demonstrated that interleaving tasks types (as opposed to blocking them) can foster learning. Do the same advantages apply to interleaving representations? We addressed this question using a variety of research methods. First, we conducted a classroom experiment with an intelligent tutoring system for fractions. We compared four practice schedules of multiple graphical representations: blocked, fully interleaved, moderately interleaved, and increasingly interleaved. Based on data from 230 4th and 5th-grade students, we found that interleaved practice leads to better learning outcomes than blocked practice on a number of measures. Second, we conducted a think-aloud study to gain insights into the learning mechanisms underlying the advantage of interleaved practice. Results show that students make connections between representations only when explicitly prompted to do so (and not spontaneously). This finding suggests that reactivation, rather than abstraction, is the main mechanism to account for the advantage of interleaved practice. Third, we used methods derived from Bayesian knowledge tracing to analyze tutor log data from the classroom experiment. Modeling latent measures of students' learning rates, we find higher learning rates for interleaved practice than for blocked practice. This finding extends prior research on practice schedules, which shows that interleaved practice (compared to blocked practice) impairs students' problem-solving performance during the practice phase when using raw performance measures such as error rates. Our findings have implications for the design of multi-representational learning materials and for research on adaptive practice schedules in intelligent tutoring systems.

However, most work on assessing student knowledge using methods such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing has focused only on modeling learning in only one context or activity, even when the same skill is encountered in multiple different activities. We investigate ways in which student learning can be modeled across activities, towards understanding the relationship between different activities and which approaches are relatively more successful at integrating information across activities. However, we find that integrating data across activities does not improve predictive power relative to using data from just one activity.

Quantitative methods were used to identify how students allocated their time across different types of modeling. Qualitative methods were used to review data from three students who spent substantial time engaged in graphical and two kinds of mathematical modeling. These students were profiled and their patterns of modeling are represented visually and described in context. Much of the modeling done by these 20 students was graphical in nature. Few students informed their thinking with mathematical representations, yet predictive mathematical modeling is essential to engineering design.

The MATHESIS meta-knowledge engineering framework for model-tracing tutors, presented in this article, aims at maximizing knowledge reuse. This is achieved through ontological representation of both the declarative and procedural knowledge of a KBS (model-tracing tutor), as well as of the declarative and procedural authoring knowledge of the process to develop a KBS. Declarative knowledge is represented in Ontology Web Language (OWL). Procedural knowledge is represented using the concepts of atomic and composite processes of OWL-S web services description ontology. The framework provides knowledge engineering tools, integrated into the Protégé OWL ontology editor, for the development and management of the KBS's ontological representation. It also provides meta-knowledge engineering tools for the ontological representation of the knowledge engineering expertise as a set of composite knowledge engineering processes and atomic knowledge engineering statements. The latter constitute a language, ONTOMATH, for building executable knowledge engineering models that, when executed by the tools, guide non-expert knowledge engineers like domain experts to the creation of new knowledge-based systems (model-tracing tutors). The framework, being in an experimental stage, was used for the development of a monomial multiplication and division tutor. However, the overall design and implementation aimed at constituting the framework as a proof-of-concept system that can be used for the meta-knowledge engineering of more complex model-tracing tutors.

Summary: In 2011, Cleveland Clinic Florida (CCF) implemented a pharmacy practice model change with the goal of providing all inpatients quality pharmaceutical care while still providing key specialty clinical pharmacy services. An LLM was initiated in which pharmacists supervise pharmacy residents and students in a team format in which students are used as pharmacist extenders. CCF partnered with local and regional colleges of pharmacy to increase the number of advanced pharmacy practice experience student rotations at CCF. Students are given accountability for a specific number of patient beds based on their rotation. They are required to perform medication histories, education on drug indication and adverse effects, discharge counseling, targeted disease counseling, and profile review for drug-related problems for their patients. After the implementation of this model, improvements were observed in Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores (58% versus 70%, respectively), pharmacy interventions per patient per day (0.9 versus 1.4, respectively), and bedside medication delivery capture rate (48% versus 65%, respectively). Conclusion: The implementation of an LLM and partnering with local colleges of pharmacy have improved pharmacy practice at CCF by allowing pharmacy students to work as pharmacist extenders in providing comprehensive pharmacy services to many patients who would not otherwise be reached. This approach has improved HCAHPS scores within the ""communication of medication"" domain, increased overall patient interventions, and allowed expansion of CCF's discharge prescription program.

The purpose of this design-based research study is to build a learning performance to identify and explore the third-grade students' baseline understanding of and their reasoning about plant-ecosystem relationships when engaged in the practices of modeling. The developed learning performance integrated scientific content and core scientific activity to identify and measure how students build knowledge about the role of plants in ecosystems through the practices of modeling. Our findings indicate that the third-grade students' ideas about plant growth include abiotic and biotic relationships. Further, they used their models to reason about how and why these relationships were necessary to maintain plant stasis. However, while the majority of the third-grade students were able to identify and reason about plant-abiotic relationships, a much smaller group reasoned about plant-abiotic-animal relationships. Implications from the study suggest that modeling serves as a tool to support elementary students in reasoning about system relationships, but they require greater curricular and instructional support in conceptualizing how and why ecosystem relationships are necessary for plant growth and development.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1089730&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Initial content analysis allowed deconstruction of drawings into salient features, with grouping of these features via factor analysis. A resulting 4-factor solution explains 62% of the data variance, suggesting that 4 archetype models of the greenhouse effect dominate thinking within this population. Factor scores, indicating the extent to which each student's drawing aligned with representative models, were compared to performance on conceptual understanding and attitudes measures, demographics, and non-cognitive features of drawings. Student drawings were also compared to drawings made by scientists to ascertain the extent to which models reflect more sophisticated and accurate models. Results indicate that student and scientist drawings share some similarities, most notably the presence of some features of the most sophisticated non-scientific model held among the study population. Prior knowledge, prior attitudes, gender, and non-cognitive components are also predictive of an individual student's model. This work presents a new technique for analyzing drawings, with general implications for the use of drawings in investigating student conceptions.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1072969&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Since the concept of knowledge tracing was proposed, there have been many studies focusing on estimating students' mastery of specific knowledge components, yet few studies paid attention to the analysis and prediction on a student's overall learning trend in the learning process. Therefore, we propose a method to analyze a student's learning trend in the learning process and predict students' performance in future learning. Firstly, we estimate the probability that the student has mastered the knowledge components with the model of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, and then model students' learning curves in the overall learning process and predict students' future performance with Regression Analysis. Experimental results show that this method can be used to fit students' learning trends well and can provide prediction with reference value for students' performances in the future learning.''","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=msn&AN=MR3394512&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

"Non-Invasive Assessment of Motivation in a Digital Educational Game.","Bedek, Michael; Seitlinger, Paul; Kopeinik, Simone; Albert, Dietrich","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games Based Learning",="20490992",,="2015","1",,"58","8","114725697",,"Academic Conferences International","Article","Educational games; Simulation methods in education; Video games in education; Academic motivation; Digital technology","behavioural indicators; game-based learning; motivation; non-invasive assessment; predictive validity","Digital educational games (DEGs) have the potential to provide an intrinsically motivating learning context. With adaptive mechanisms that react to the learner's current motivational state this potential can be further exploited. A learner model, based on continuous and valid assessment of a learner's motivational state is required. However, it would impair the flow-experience (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) if a learner is repeatedly asked to evaluate his or her current motivational state, e.g. by a questionnaire that occurs in short time intervals on the screen. Hence, it is necessary to apply an approach that assesses the motivational state in an ongoing, implicit and non-invasive way. We suggest a non-invasive assessment procedure that is based on the observation and interpretation of so-called behavioural indicators (BIs), i.e. learner's actions and interactions with the virtual environment that are gathered as log-data. A substantial set of behavioural indicators has been elaborated, such as mouse-click rate, whereby some of them are derived from information foraging theory (Pirolli and Card, 1999). For example, the relative amount of time the learner is exploring the virtual environment can be considered as between-patch processing while the relative amount of time the learner is communicating with other game characters can be considered as within-patch processing. Values for each behavioural indicator (e.g. amount, frequency, seconds, etc.) are gathered repeatedly after predefined time slices, lasting for 40 seconds. The paper describes the results of an empirical investigation to examine the predictive validity of the BIs. Participants played a DEG while being asked to answer items of a short form of the Questionnaire of Current Motivation (QCM; Rheinberg, Vollmeyer and Burns, 2001). The QCM has been developed to measure current motivation in learning situations with respect to four factors: anxiety (of failure), probability of success, interest and challenge. Multiple linear regression models with the BIs as predictor variables and the QCM's scales as criteria allowed for predicting probability of success, interest and challenge. There was no valid BI for the fourth scale of the QCM, anxiety. We conclude that our approach, being a valid non-invasive assessment procedure suits well to fairly evaluate the effectiveness of on-line game adaptations that aim to enhance the learner's motivational state.

However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge; in addition to being a poor model of human acquisition of prior knowledge, manual knowledge-encoding is both time-consuming and error-prone. Previous research has shown that one of the key factors that differentiates experts and novices is their different representations of knowledge. Experts view the world in terms of deep functional features, while novices view it in terms of shallow perceptual features. Moreover, since the performance of learning algorithms is sensitive to representation, the deep features are also important in achieving effective machine learning. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm that acquires representation knowledge in the form of “deep features”, and demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain of algebra as well as synthetic domains. We integrate this algorithm into a machine-learning agent, SimStudent, which learns procedural knowledge by observing a tutor solve sample problems, and by getting feedback while actively solving problems on its own. We show that learning “deep features” reduces the requirements for knowledge engineering. Moreover, we propose an approach that automatically discovers student models using the extended SimStudent. By fitting the discovered model to real student learning curve data, we show that it is a better student model than human-generated models, and demonstrate how the discovered model may be used to improve a tutoring system's instructional strategy.

Specifically, when considering key facets of modeling instruction or design features of modeling curriculum, the studies in the special issue provided insight into productive ways in which teachers engaged students in modeling practices. Further, modeling pedagogies-pedagogies for transforming scientific practices of modeling into students' experience-were reified so that how these pedagogies could be coordinated into classroom instruction was revealed. When characteristic features of students' engagement in modeling were considered, research offered insight into productive model-based learning sequences for K-6 modelers and how students' development of productive epistemologies can evolve differently. Finally, the special issue considered how technology facilitated cognitive processes and/or instructional practices by examining learners' interactions with technology within modeling contexts. In this, instructional sequences using agent-based modeling (ABM) as a central technology are shared. These include the role of ABM in scaling student-modeling experiences beyond individuals to classroom experiences and how ABM can support student investigations of complex phenomenon that is not directly observable, among other affordances.

The system suggests adaptations and the student also submits his/her adaptation preference. When the student preference opposes the system suggestion, the student then negotiates with the system to reach an agreement of adaptation. A negotiation-based adaptive learning system (NALS) is implemented to support the generation of personalized adaptive learning sequences by system negotiations with students regarding assessments of learning performance (i.e. negotiated open student model) of the current content and choices of the next learning content (i.e. negotiation of adaptation). Students require two metacognitions in deciding adaptive learning sequences: self-assessment for evaluating their understanding of the current content and regulation for choosing appropriate learning content. Negotiated open student model are used for assist student self-assessment and negotiation of adaptation are used for assist student regulation of content choices. An experiment was conducted to compare a system-controlled adaptive learning system (SALS, adaptivity), a user-controlled adaptive learning system (UALS, adaptability), and a NALS. The results revealed that NALS promoted better metacognitions in student calibration (i.e. self-assessment) accuracy and learning content choices (i.e. regulation). Preliminary evidences also showed that NALS promoted better student performance in a delay test. The results further suggested that students with poor calibration accuracy and inappropriate content choices were not suitable to use UALS and were suitable to use SALS. The NALS can also be used for training students to make appropriate adaptation for learning.

With this approach both student modeling and adaptation are based on coarse-grained knowledge units that we called topics. Our motivation for the topic-based personalization was to enhance AES transparency for both teachers and students by utilizing typical topic-based course structures as the foundation for designing all aspects of an AES from the domain model to the end-user interface. We illustrate the details of the topic-based personalization technology, with the help of the Web-based educational service QuizGuide-the first system to implement it. QuizGuide applies the topic-based personalization to guide students to the right learning material in the context of an undergraduate C programming course. While having a number of architectural and practical advantages, the suggested coarse-grained personalization approach deviates from the common practices toward knowledge modeling in AES. Therefore, we believe that several aspects of QuizGuide required a detailed evaluation-from modeling accuracy to the effectiveness of adaptation. The paper discusses how this new student modeling approach can be evaluated, and presents our attempts to evaluate it from multiple different prospects. The evaluation of QuizGuide across several consecutive semesters demonstrates that, although topics do not always support precise user modeling, they can provide a basis for successful personalization in AESs.

Learning styles are one of the most important parameters in determining individual differences. Accordingly, traditional web-based learning environments have been replaced by individualized adaptive e-learning environments on the basis of learning styles which are more innovative. This study deals with the content analysis of the recent studies on Adaptive Educational Hypermedia (AEH) based on learning styles. 69 articles published from 2005 to 2014 were obtained through a comprehensive and detailed review. Afterwards, these studies were subjected to document analysis. The studies were categorized under the titles of purpose, nature, method, characteristics of examinees, level, data collection tool, learner modelling, learning styles, subject, and findings. Some of the studies offered a framework or proposed a model for AEH while others focused on the influence of AEH on academic achievement and learning outputs as well as learning satisfaction. This study examines the existing tendencies and gaps in the literature and discusses the potential research topics.

Teaching SPM is a challenging task, mainly because it lays great emphasis on theory and offers few practical exercises. Furthermore, as yet few teaching approaches have aimed at teaching SPM by introducing innovative features, such as games. The use of games has mainly been focused on other areas of software engineering, for example software project management. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper describes a formal experiment carried out to assess the learning effectiveness of a serious game (DesigMPS), designed to support the teaching of SPM, and to compare game-based learning with a project-based learning method. In the DesigMPS game, the student models a software process from an SPI perspective, based on the Brazilian SPI model (MPS.BR). The results indicate that playing the game can have a positive learning effect and results in a greater degree of learning effectiveness than does the project-based learning instructional method.

The context within which we develop this framework is the English language arts (ELA) for K-12 students, though the framework could easily be applied to cover reading, writing, and critical thinking skills from pre-K through college. Central to the framework is the concept of a ""key practice,"" drawn from constructivist learning theory, which emphasizes the purposeful social context within which skills are recruited and organized to carry out complex literacy tasks. We argue that key practices provide a key link between existing ""CBAL""™ ELA learning progressions (defined as part of a student model for literacy skills) and the structure of well-designed SBAs. This structure enables us to design assessments that model a key practice, supporting the systematic creation of task sequences that can be used to support both instruction and assessment.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1109321&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

As interactive problem solving activities become increasingly common in educational systems, it is useful to focus also on timing information associated with problem solving. We argue that the focus on timing is natural for certain types of educational problems and we describe a simple model of problem solving times which assumes a linear relationship between a latent problem solving skill and a logarithm of a time to solve a problem. The model is closely related to models from two different areas: the item response theory and collaborative filtering. We describe two parameter estimation techniques for the model and several extensions - models with multidimensional skill, learning, or variability of performance. We describe an application of the proposed models in a widely used computerized practice system. Using both simulated data and real data from the system we evaluate the model, analyse its parameter values, and discuss the insight into problem difficulty which the model brings.

However, diagnosing a clinical case poses several challenges that are inherent to solving multifaceted ill-structured problems. In particular, when solving such problems, the complexity stems from the existence of multiple paths to arriving at the correct solution (Lajoie, 2003). Moreover, the approach one employs in diagnosing a clinical case is in some measure dependent upon the complexity of the case. This leads us to the question: Are there differences in the manner in which novices solve cases with varying levels of complexity in a computer-based learning environment? More specifically, we are interested in understanding and elucidating if there are clinical reasoning differences in regards to accuracy, efficiency, and process across three virtual patient cases of varying difficulty levels. Examining such differences may have implications from both a learner modelling and system enhancement perspective.

These have proven successful only in labs, or use theories of emotion not associated with an educational setting. The Control-value theory of ""achievement emotions"" holds that appraisals of control and value are most meaningful when determining emotion. This paper focuses on the design and evaluation of an emotional student model of Control-value theory applied to online GBL environments using Approach 2. This model is implemented using a dynamic sequence of Bayesian Networks (BNs). ""PlayPhysics""--an emotional GBL environment for teaching Physics--was designed, implemented and evaluated with 118 students at ITESMCCM.

Recent advances in data mining techniques provide new possibilities and exciting opportunities for developing adaptive systems to better support learners. This study is situated in the context of clinical reasoning in an Intelligent Tutoring System called BioWorld and it aims to examine the relationship between the lab-tests ordered and misconceptions held by learners. Toward this end, we employ an EDM technique called subgroup discovery to unpack the rules that embody the hypothesized link. Examining such links may have implications for identifying the points along learning trajectories where learners should be provided the requisite scaffolding.

In this paper, the authors present five sampling algorithms (Random Walk, Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk, Forest Fire, Snowball and Represent algorithm) and investigate which structural properties of the domain knowledge sample are preserved after sampling process is conducted. Findings: The samples that the authors got using these algorithms are compared and the authors have compared their cumulative node degree distributions, clustering coefficients and the length of the shortest paths in a sampled graph in order to find the best one.

We show that while drawing on already published images, some third-year undergraduates are able to ""curate"" novel, and yet plausible causal channels in their graphic representations, implicating new phenomenal potentials as lead researchers do in their review-type academic publications. Our work links the virtues of drawing to learn to the disclosure of potential epistemic things, involving close attention to the contours of non-linguistic stuff and corresponding sensory perception of substance; space; time; shape and size; position; and force.

This paper presents the quantitative and qualitative findings from a pilot study to determine the impact of the Healthy Learner model, where an experienced primary care nurse was embedded in a learning support team in a disadvantaged high school. Students entering high school with National Assessment Program, Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) scores in the lowest quartile for the school were assessed by the nurse and identified health issues addressed. Thirty-nine students were assessed in 2012-13 and there were up to seven health problems identified per student, ranging from serious neglect to problems such as uncorrected vision or hearing. Many of these problems were having an impact on the student and their ability to engage in learning. Families struggled to navigate the health system, they had difficulty explaining the student's problems to health professionals and costs were a barrier. Adding a nurse to the learning support team in this disadvantaged high school was feasible and identified considerable unmet health needs that affect a student's ability to learn.

Teachers can use an authoring tool to create large item pools of different types of questions, including multiple choice, open answer, generative questions, and complex tasks. Siette can be used for formative and summative assessment and incorporates different learning elements, including scaffolding features, such as hints, feedback, and misconceptions. It includes numerous other features covering different educational needs and techniques, such as spaced repetition, collaborative testing, or pervasive learning. Siette is designed as a web-based assessment component that can be semantically integrated with intelligent systems or with large LMSs, such as Moodle. This article reviews the evolution of the Siette system, presents information on its use, and analyses this information from a broader and critical perspective on the use of intelligent systems in education.

The aim was for SMILI☺ to provide researchers with a systematic way to describe, compare and critique OLMs. We expected it to highlight those areas where there had been considerable OLM work, as well as those that had been neglected. However, we observed that SMILI☺ was not used in these ways. We now reflect on the reasons for this, and conclude that it has actually served a broader role in defining the notion of OLM and informing OLM design. Since the initial SMILI☺ paper, much has changed in technology-enhanced learning. Notably, learning technology has become far more pervasive, both in formal and lifelong learning. This provides huge, and still growing amounts of learning data. The fields of Learning Analytics (LA), Learning at Scale (L@S), Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Quantified Self (QS) have emerged. This paper argues that there has also been an important shift in the nature and role of learner models even within Artificial Intelligence in Education and Intelligent Tutoring Systems research. In light of these trends, and reflecting on the use of SMILI☺, this paper presents a revised and simpler version of SMILI☺ alongside the original version. In both cases there are additional categories to encompass new trends, which can be applied, omitted or substituted as required. We now offer this as a guide for designers of interfaces for OLMs, learning analytics and related fields, and we highlight the areas where there is need for more research.

This seemingly simple system had substantial, and surprising, ramifications. Over time it transformed each of our perspectives as to the issues facing AIED. In this paper we reflect on the influence of the PHelpS peer help system on our subsequent research agenda as well as some of the broader influences of our work. In particular, we discuss a number of research projects arising out of PHelpS directly or indirectly, including the I-Help (aka iHelp) system, a peer help system that has been widely deployed in university courses; a distributed multi-agent architecture for peer help systems that uses fragmented learner modelling to support its activities; the active user modelling paradigm which views 'learner model' as a computation not a knowledge structure; the ecological approach, a general architecture for learning systems in which patterns mined from learner interactions with learning objects inform pedagogical decisions; investigations, especially into privacy and reputation, arising from the large scale deployment of iHelp supported by evidence mined from iHelp data; and research into novel affective and social motivation techniques. We conclude by discussing the implications of the common perspective that has emerged from these interrelated research projects. This perspective views the goal of learning technology design to be to track learners as they carry out authentic activities, to deeply understand these learners and their learning context, and to provide just in time support for their learning.

Additionally, methods for detecting collaboration patterns in group action logs were introduced. The approach was exemplified with several applications in the areas of mathematics and general problems solving.

Specific examples are provided as illustrations (Facebook, Second Life and mobile assisted language learning (MALL)), though the approach is a general one. We describe the Next-TELL open learner model as an exemplar that can encompass a range of data from a variety of technologies and activities, and as a competence-focussed visual analytics tool that can be readily used inside and outside the classroom.The Next-TELL open learner model offers several visualisations for learners and teachers to explore the learner’s current competences, which can be selected according to user preferences or the purpose of viewing the learning data. The selection of visualisations means that the open learner model is appropriate for school, university and other learning contexts. Viewing this data can help students to reflect on and monitor their learning, and can support teachers’ decision-making during classroom activities or later, in their planning of subsequent sessions. As an example, we outline the use of the Next-TELL open learner model in a school in Norway.

The second is which technique would be appropriate for learners grouping according to the selected learner model. This paper aims to propose a novel cooperative learning approach using a multiple-intelligence based learners grouping technique. This contribution is three folds: (1) a conceptual model of learners' intelligence, (2) a pre-learning process that aims at: (a) acquiring knowledge of individual learners' intelligence according to the conceptual model of learners' intelligence; (b) grouping the learners into balanced groups based on this intelligence; and (c) calculating knowledge of collective intelligence, useful for cooperative learning during the learning process, and (3) a framework architecture, in order to support the new cooperative learning approach and demonstrate its feasibility.

Attributable to the changeable and complex environment, traditional pedagogical methods in building construction courses cannot equip students with concrete experience and knowledge. Despite several studies, adapting information and communication technology (ICT) tools such as virtual reality (VR) to enhance construction education, limited interaction and low detail of virtual contents still remain an unsolved issue. To address this problem, this study proposes an interactive building anatomy modeling (IBAM) system, which allows students to conveniently interact with VR environment for experiential building construction education. The IBAM system is developed based on the medical anatomy concept, including intuitive features, which support detaching and attaching components; and dissecting which enhances student-model interaction. To identify the advantages and limitations of IBAM, a prototype was developed, and its applicability was verified through a case study. Interim results suggest that the system facilitates experiential learning and provides adequate levels of interaction to effectively transfer knowledge to learners.

We frame the problem of optimally selecting teaching actions using a decision-theoretic approach and show how to formulate teaching as a partially observable Markov decision process planning problem. This framework makes it possible to explore how different assumptions about student learning and behavior should affect the selection of teaching actions. We consider how to apply this framework to concept learning problems, and we present approximate methods for finding optimal teaching actions, given the large state and action spaces that arise in teaching. Through simulations and behavioral experiments, we explore the consequences of choosing teacher actions under different assumed student models. In two concept-learning tasks, we show that this technique can accelerate learning relative to baseline performance.

A pilot study using the Augmented Reality sandbox (AR sandbox) suggests it can be a powerful tool for bridging the gap between two-dimensional (2D) representations and real landscapes, as well as enhancing the spatial thinking and modeling abilities of students. The AR sandbox involves a real box of sand with virtual contour lines and a water flow model created using a three-dimensional (3D) scanning camera, visualization software, and a projector. It was used in undergraduate, physical geology courses to teach topographic maps and surficial features and processes. The instructor demonstrated topographic concepts (contour lines, topographic profiles, etc.), and students engaged in model building of coastal and fluvial environments (drainage basins, cutoffs, longshore transport, sea-level rise, spits, flooding, etc.). The virtual water flow model was used to illustrate water flow dynamics on surface features. With the AR sandbox connected to a computer monitor, students could simultaneously see 3D landscapes in the sandbox and their corresponding 2D images on the monitor. Students used camera phones to capture landscape models they built and submitted them via e-mail for grading. Exit surveys indicated students were overwhelmingly positive (97%) in their perception of how the AR sandbox improved their understanding of learning objectives. They also preferred AR sandbox activities when compared to traditional laboratories that used only topographic maps. Effective classroom use of the AR sandbox required developing student-modeling exercises that took advantage of real-time feedback, virtual water, and physical modeling activities. While data are limited and more research is needed, real-time feedback on student models by both the students and the instructor suggests sandbox models are particularly useful for dispelling student misconceptions.

A brief multi-element design was used to test effectiveness of four interventions on letter formation. These interventions included goal setting plus contingent reinforcement, graphical feedback, error correction and modeling. For one student, modeling was effective; for the two remaining students, goal setting plus contingent reinforcement was effective. The results of this study extend the BEA literature by investigating the effects of interventions for improving letter formation in students with intellectual disabilities.

Recommender Systems are more advanced in this aspect than Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and Intelligent Learning Environments (ILEs). A reason for this is that the user models of Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Intelligent Learning Environments, i.e. their student models, tend to be more heterogeneous and complex than traditional models used in Recommender Systems. To share and reuse student models we must first understand the restrictions for porting or reusing student models in new ITSs or ILEs. This paper proposes a classification of student models in terms of their portability. Portability is measured via each model's accessibility, complexity, architecture, popularity, and description. We use this classification to analyse and then grade student models that have been published in the AIED, EDM and ITS research communities in 2013 and 2014. The classification is intended to be used by researchers both as a methodology to measure the portability of a student model and as a guide to find existing reusable models.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1104198&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The fundamental building block of the neural network is O-neurons that can generate an oscillation in its transfer functions. Since the natural policy gradient learning has been used in training a central pattern generator paradigm, it is called Natural Learner CPG Neural Networks (NLCPGNN). O-neurons are connected and coupled to each other in order to shape a network and their unknown parameters are found by a natural policy gradient learning algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is design of this learning algorithm which is able to simultaneously search for the weights and topology of the network. This system is capable to obtain any complex motion and rhythmic trajectory via first layer and learn rhythmic trajectories in the second layer and converge towards all these movements. Moreover this two layers system is able to provide various features of a learner model for instance resistance against perturbations, modulation of trajectories amplitude and frequency. Simulation of the learning system in the robot simulator (WEBOTS) that is linked with MATLAB software has been done. Implementation on a real NAO robot demonstrates that the robot has learned desired motion with high accuracy. These results show proposed system produces high convergence rate and low test errors.

Traditional OLMs assume a learner to be able to manage their own learning and already in an appropriate affective/behavioral state that is conducive for learning. This paper proposes a new perspective of learning that advances the state of the art in fully-negotiated OLMs by exploiting learner's affective & behavioral states to generate engaging natural language dialogues that train them to enhance their metacognitive skills. In order to achieve this, we have developed the NDLtutor that provides a natural language interface to learners. Our system generates context-aware dialogues automatically to enhance learner participation and reflection. This paper provides details on the design and implementation of the NDLtutor and discusses two evaluation studies. The first evaluation study focuses on the dialogue management capabilities of our system and demonstrates that our dialog system works satisfactorily to realize meaningful and natural interactions for negotiation. The second evaluation study investigates the effects of our system on the self-assessment and self-reflection of the learners. The results of the evaluations show that the NDLtutor is able to produce significant improvements in the self-assessment accuracy of the learners and also provides adequate support for prompting self-reflection in learners.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1114517&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Using the benefits of the computer game in the classroom without conforming the didactical aspects, could produce results slightly different from the main pedagogical objectives. Because of the specific nature of the game and playing there are not established yet standards supporting the learning process based on computer games. This circumstance determines the complexity of the synthesis of a student model that is to be built in a learning game. This paper discusses the idea about a WEB based platform for learning game composing which follows a new model of the student in a learning game, based on a certain didactical model. Methods: The model is synthesized on the base of a preliminarily defined didactical model and outlines the basic fields, corresponding to the process of acquiring knowledge using a learning game. A substantial differences between traditional e-Learning and game based learning approaches are examined. Results: The basic concept and notation of the proposed student model is presented and further the model is described in details. The model is organized in three areas, reflecting activities, individualities and knowledge of the students: Interaction area, Archetype area and Competence area. The model areas are embraced by a Stimulus environment giving the context of the model, namely that the model represents a student who learns while playing a learning game. The main advantage of the model is the convergence of the computer game and the didactical approach in a stimulus environment for learning. The proposed model could be used not only for a learning game referred to a specific subject domain, but also for a WEB-based platform for interdisciplinary learning games composing.

In this paper, a dashboard for visualizing and inspecting early detected reading difficulties and their characteristics, called PADA (acronym for the Spanish name ""Panel de Analíticas de Aprendizaje de Dislexia en Adultos""), is presented. PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better understanding by students about their learner model. Through information visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their learner models in order to help them to increase their awareness and to support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in reading. PADA provides different learning analytics on reading performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning. This paper describes examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts, line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the students. We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic. The results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and help them to understand their difficulties associated with the reading tasks, as well as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the learning process. Implications for the design of learning analytics are discussed and directions for future work are outlined.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1141042&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The proposed approach includes three phases, namely design of the educational game, collection of traces and personality prediction. To evaluate the efficiency of MoPEG, an experiment was conducted with thirty learners where their personality modeling results using MoPEG are compared to the Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaire. The obtained results showed that the accuracy level of MoPEG is significant with an 80% of similarity. Besides, based on the Kappa method, used by psychologists to measure the similarity of two instruments.

The adaptation module uses this estimation to automatically plan an adapted sequence of in-game situations optimizing learning. We implemented our architecture in Game of Homes, a simulation serious game, which aims to train adults the basics of real estate. We built a scripted-based version of Game of Homes in order to compare the impact of scripted-based scenarios versus generated scenarios on learning progression. We qualitatively analyzed logs files of thirty-six adults who played Game of Homes for 90 minutes.

Design/methodology/approach: Regularized logistic regression was used to create a quantitative model of problem solving performance of students that predicts whether students can solve a mathematics problem correctly based on how well they solved other problems in the past. The usefulness of the model was evaluated by comparing the predicted probability of correct problem solving to the actual problem solving performance on the data set that was not used in the model building process. Findings: The regularized logistic regression model showed a better predictive power than the standard Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model, the most frequently used quantitative model of student learning in the Educational Data Mining research. Originality/value: Providing instructional scaffolding is critical in order to facilitate student learning. However, most computer-based learning environments use heuristics or rely on the discretion of students when they determine whether instructional scaffolding needs be provided. The predictive model of problem solving performance of students can be used as a quantitative guideline that can help make a better decision on when to provide instructional supports and guidance in the computer-based learning environment, which can potentially maximize the learning outcome of students.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1156347&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

However, teachers' difficulties in assessing student modelling work are a challenge to be considered when implementing modelling in the classroom. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate how teachers' knowledge on generating assessment criteria for assessing student competence in mathematical modelling evolved through a professional development programme, which is based on a lesson study approach and modelling perspective. The data was collected with four teachers from two public high schools over a five-month period. The professional development programme included a cyclical process, with each cycle consisting of an introductory meeting, the implementation of a model-eliciting activity with students, and a follow-up meeting. The results showed that the professional development programme contributed to teachers' knowledge for generating assessment criteria on the products, and the observable actions that affect the modelling cycle.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1143700&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The main purpose of this learning method is to offer customized content, experience or tools, based on the learning profile of students (learning style, gender, prior knowledge, learning goals and so on), so as to improve the learning outcomes. There are two wide-known adaption techniques implemented by learning systems to provide individual instruction: adaptability and adaptivity. The first one allows the students to take control, e.g. the learning system provides choices to let the students adapt the steps, sequences, difficulty level, preferences, while the second empowers the system, which is able to build a student model and to provide learning support based on that model. The current paper presents PoliCAT - a learning system based on Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) principle, which implements the second adaption technique (adaptivity) to provide individual instruction. Furthermore, the proposed webbased application supports the new learning paradigms, e.g. student-centered learning, communities of practice, and constructivism in general and relies on the current technologies - Web 2.0 and social Web, as students are able to share one's results on social media. The system is described as a useful tool for self-regulated learning, answering thus at the question whether assessment may have a strong formative role in learning or not. Besides highlighting the key features of the application, the paper provides experimental results from a web programming course for forth year students enrolled in an engineering degree program, who used the developed system as a learning tool during one semester. Students reported that they succeeded in strengthening their study skills and monitoring their academic progress through the learning analytics features. The available personalized feedback PoliCAT, as well as the possibility to share one's results in an e-community makes the instrument to be an attractive tool for today's social and cultural values of students, fact proven by the experiment as well.

Maintaining learning histories and personal profiles of individual learners enabled a program to adapt the delivery of learning materials to the record of student performance. Given a limited number of users working within a single system, the data generated could be collected and analyzed easily, using simple methods and tools such as spreadsheets and basic data models. The situation today is quite different from that scenario. Learners are likely to be using multiple online tools and services, all of which may be recording data. That includes general use software and services such as Facebook and Google, as well as mobile devices. If they are university students, they are likely to be generating data points through a learning management system (LMS) as well as from other university-level systems. The vast amount of information collected today from our use of online tools and services provides a huge storehouse of information that can be mined to provide both general usage trends and individualized reports.

Rating and predicting students' educational achievement using arithmetical and statistical procedures may not explicitly advise the best route to estimate human acquisition of knowledge and experiences. Researchers in this field tended to adopt soft computing to defeat the challenges of analytical techniques in order to resolve this evaluation performance problem. Fuzzy logic is utilised to manage the intrinsic uncertainty associated with teachers' subjective assessments and permits reproduction of student modelling in the linguistic form – the same form the human teachers do. The obstacle with existing fuzzy rule‐based systems is that the size of the rule base (the number of rules) grows exponentially with the expansion of the number of fuzzy sets included in the rules. This exponential increment in the size of the rule base enlarges the search time and the memory space needed. In this study, a fuzzy rule base compaction (densification) using genetic algorithm is suggested for uncertain measurement of student's performance. The proposed approach consists of three stages: knowledge recovery, coding, and compaction or optimisation. The comparative outcomes demonstrated that the recommended evaluator has a magnificent dynamic response than that of the traditional one.

The abundance of available content has produced at least two problems: how to help students find the most appropriate resources and how to engage them in using and benefiting from these resources. Personalized and social learning have been suggested as potential ways to address these problems. Our work attempts to integrate these directions of research by combining the ideas of adaptive navigation support and open student modeling with the ideas of social comparison and social visualization. We call our approach Open Social Student Modeling (OSSM). Objective/Research Questions: First, we review a sequence of our earlier projects focused on Open Social Student Modeling for one kind of learning content and formulate several key design principles that contribute to the success of OSSM. Second, we present our exploration of OSSM in a more challenging context of modeling student progress for two kinds of learning content in parallel. We aim to answer the following research questions: How do we design OSSM interfaces to support many kinds of learning content in parallel? Will current identified design principles (key features) confirm the power of the learning community through OSSM with multiple learning-resource collections? Will the OSSM visualization provide successful personalized guidance within a richer collection of educational resources? Research Design: We designed four classroom studies to assess the value of different options for OSSM visualization of one and multiple kinds of learning content in the context of programming-language learning. We examined the comparative success of different design options to distill successful design patterns and other important lessons for the future developers of OSSM for personalized and social e-learning. Findings/Results: The results confirmed the motivational impact of personalized social guidance provided by the OSSM system in the target context. The interface encouraged students to explore more topics and motivated them to work ahead of the course schedule. Both strong and weak students worked with the appropriate levels of questions for their readiness, which yielded consistent performance across different levels of complex problems. Additionally, providing more realistic content collection on the navigation-supported OSSM visualizations resulted in uniform performance for the group. Conclusions/Recommendation: A sequence of studies of several OSSM interfaces confirmed that a combination of adaptive navigational support, open student modeling, and social visualization in the form of the OSSM interface can reinforce the navigational and motivational values of these approaches. In several contexts, the OSSM interface demonstrated its ability to offer effective guidance in helping students to locate the most relevant content at the right time while increasing student motivation to work with diverse learning content.

In this paper, we develop a learner modeling and adaptive scaffolding framework for Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling (CTSiM)-an open ended learning environment that supports synergistic learning of science and Computational Thinking (CT) for middle school students. In CTSiM, students have the freedom to choose and coordinate use of the different tools provided in the environment, as they build and test their models. However, the open-ended nature of the environment makes it hard to interpret the intent of students' actions, and to provide useful feedback and hints that improves student understanding and helps them achieve their learning goals. To address this challenge, we define an extended learner modeling scheme that uses (1) a hierarchical task model for the CTSiM environment, (2) a set of strategies that support effective learning and model building, and (3) effectiveness and coherence measures that help us evaluate student's proficiency in the different tasks and strategies. We use this scheme to dynamically scaffold learners when they are deficient in performing their tasks, or they demonstrate suboptimal use of strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a classroom study where one group of 6th grade students received scaffolding and the other did not. We found that students who received scaffolding built more accurate models, used modeling strategies effectively, adopted more useful modeling behaviors, showed a better understanding of important science and CT concepts, and transferred their modeling skills better to new scenarios.

Yet few classroom experiments have been conducted to empirically evaluate whether and how an OLM can enhance students' domain level learning outcomes through the scaffolding of SRL processes in an ITS. In two classroom experiments with a total of 302 7th- and 8th-grade students, we investigated the effect of (a) an OLM that supports students' self-assessment of their equation-solving skills and (b) shared control over problem selection, on students' equation-solving abilities, enjoyment of learning with the tutor, self-assessment accuracy, and problem selection decisions. In the first, smaller experiment, the hypothesized main effect of the OLM on students' learning outcomes was confirmed; we found no main effect of shared control of problem selection, nor an interaction. In the second, larger experiment, the hypothesized main effects were not confirmed, but we found an interaction such that the students who had access to the OLM learned significantly better equation-solving skills than their counterparts when shared control over problem selection was offered in the system. Thus, the two experiments support the notion that an OLM can enhance students' domain-level learning outcomes through scaffolding of SRL processes, and are among the first in-vivo classroom experiments to do so. They suggest that an OLM is especially effective if it is designed to support multiple SRL processes.

We propose a modular approach to the development of such adaptive practice systems: dissecting the system design into an estimation of prior knowledge, an estimation of current knowledge, and the construction of questions. We provide a detailed discussion of learner models for both estimation steps, including a novel use of the Elo rating system for learner modeling. We implemented the proposed approach in a system for practising geography facts; the system is widely used and allows us to perform evaluation of all three modules. We compare the predictive accuracy of different learner models, discuss insights gained from learner modeling, as well as the impact different variants of the system have on learners' engagement and learning.

A core objective of the learner model is to adapt formative feedback based on students' affective states. Types of adaptation include what type of formative feedback should be provided and how it should be presented. Two Bayesian networks trained with data gathered in a series of Wizard-of-Oz studies are used for the adaptation process. This paper reports results from a quasi-experimental evaluation, in authentic classroom settings, which compared a version of iTalk2Learn that adapted feedback based on students' affective states as they were talking aloud with the system (the affect condition) with one that provided feedback based only on the students' performance (the non-affect condition). Our results suggest that affect-aware support contributes to reducing boredom and off-task behavior, and may have an effect on learning. We discuss the internal and ecological validity of the study, in light of pedagogical considerations that informed the design of the two conditions. Overall, the results of the study have implications both for the design of educational technology and for classroom approaches to teaching, because they highlight the important role that affect-aware modelling plays in the adaptive delivery of formative feedback to support learning.

"Learners' perceptions of practices in local anesthesia education.","Aboytes, Diana B.; Calleros, Christina","Canadian Journal of Dental Hygiene",="1712171X",,="Jun2017","51","2","75","5","123816859",,"Canadian Dental Hygienists Association","pictorial","Anesthesia, Local Education; Students, Dental Hygiene; Education, Baccalaureate; Student Attitudes Evaluation; Education, Dental Hygiene; Human; Descriptive Research; Convenience Sample; Descriptive Statistics; Pretest-Posttest Design; Surveys; Randomized Controlled Trials; Random Assignment; P-Value; Fisher's Exact Test; Male; Female; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Age; Injections; Adult: 19-44 years; Middle Aged: 45-64 years; Male; Female",,"Background: The purpose of this descriptive study was to evaluate perceptions of local anesthesia learners and to identify practices that would aid in increasing and improving clinical confidence and performance. Methods: A convenience sample of 23 dental hygiene students in a baccalaureate degree program was given a pretest survey upon completion of the didactic component of their local anesthesia course. Participants were randomly assigned into test and control groups and given a practice device. After a practice session, a posttest survey was administered and a descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Results: The pretest survey revealed that 91% of participants felt prepared to begin the clinical portion of their local anesthesia course, and 96% felt the student-to-student model was critical in learning how to administer local anesthesia injections. Posttest results remained unchanged in both test and control groups (p < 1.0). Pretest results also showed that 74% of participants preferred that their first local anesthesia injection be on a model/typodont. Posttest results demonstrated a statistically significant shift in this preference (p < 0.02), with 67% in the test group and 63% in the control group preferring a human subject for their first injection. Discussion: In this study, the practice itself was the cause of changing perceptions rather than the device; thus the experience alone shaped the students’ perceptions. Conclusion: Adjuncts to local anesthesia education contribute to learning, but are unlikely to replace the student-tostudent model. Those seeking to increase their scope to include local anesthesia administration should expect to learn via this traditional method. Contexte : La présente étude descriptive visait à évaluer la perception des apprenants qui suivent un cours sur l’anesthésie locale et à cerner les techniques qui pourraient contribuer à augmenter la confiance et à améliorer la performance. Méthodes : Un échantillon de commodité de 23 étudiants du programme d’hygiène dentaire de niveau baccalauréat a participé à un sondage prétest après avoir complété le volet didactique de leur cours d’anesthésie locale. Les participants ont été affectés au hasard à un groupe test ou à un groupe témoin, et ils ont reçu un mannequin d’entraînement. Après une séance d’exercice, un sondage posttest et une analyse statistique descriptive ont été réalisés. Résultats : Le sondage prétest a révélé que 91 % des participants se sentaient prêts à commencer la partie clinique de leur cours d’anesthésie locale et 96 % croyaient que l’entraînement entre étudiants était essentiel pour apprendre comment administrer des injections d’anesthésie locale. Les résultats posttests du groupe test et du groupe de contrôle sont demeurés inchangés (p < 1.0). Les résultats prétests ont aussi démontré que 74 % des participants préféraient administrer leur première injection d’anesthésie locale sur un mannequin. Les résultats posttests ont indiqué que la préférence des sujets a été modifiée de manière statistiquement significative (p < 0.02), puisque 67 % des participants du groupe test et 63 % des participants du groupe de contrôle ont préféré que leur première injection soit effectuée sur un sujet humain. Discussion : Dans cette étude, l’exercice en soi était responsable du changement de perception, plutôt que le choix du sujet utilisé. L’expérience en elle-même a façonné la perception des étudiants. Conclusion : Les compléments à la formation en anesthésie locale contribuent à l’apprentissage, mais ils ne remplacent vraisemblablement pas l’entraînement entre étudiants. Ceux qui cherchent à augmenter leur champ d’exercice et à y inclure l’administration de l’anesthésie locale devraient s’attendre à apprendre au moyen de cette méthode traditionnelle.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cin20&AN=123816859&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

However, similarly to other Exploratory Learning Environments, students may not always learn effectively in these unstructured environments. Thus, providing adaptive support has great potential to help improve student learning with these rich activities. Providing adaptive support requires a student model that can both evaluate learning as well inform relevant feedback. Building such a model for interactive simulations is especially challenging because the exploratory nature of the interaction makes it hard to know a priori which behaviors are conducive to learning. To address this problem, in this paper we leverage the student modeling framework proposed in (Kardan and Conati, 2011) to specifically address the challenge of modeling students in interactive simulations. The framework has already been successfully applied to build a student model and to give adaptive interventions for an interactive simulation for constraint satisfaction. We seek to investigate the generality of the framework by building student models for a more complex simulation on electric circuits called Circuit Construction Kit (CCK). We evaluate alternative representations of logged interaction data with CCK, capturing different amounts of granularity and feature engineering. We then apply the student modeling framework proposed in (Kardan and Conati, 2011) to group students based on their interaction behaviors, map these behaviors into learning outcomes and leverage the resulting clusters to classify new learners. Data collected from 100 college students working with the CCK simulation indicates that the proposed framework is able to successfully classify students in groups of high and low learners and identify patterns of productive behaviors that are common across representations that can inform real-time feedback. In addition to presenting these results, we discuss trade-offs between levels of granularity and feature engineering in the tested interaction representations in terms of their ability to evaluate learning, classify students, and inform feedback.

Simulation using the standardized student model has been used to train health care preceptors in medicine. To our knowledge, there are no reports utilizing interprofessional objective structured teaching exercises (iOSTE) to train pharmacy preceptors. The primary objectives of this pilot study were to evaluate the effects of iOSTE on the pharmacy preceptors' perceived importance of the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) core competencies and confidence in precepting interprofessional students. Additionally, data were collected regarding pharmacy preceptors' prior experiences in simulation and debriefing. Educational Activity and Setting: Preceptors (n=23) participated in an iOSTE and debriefed with trained standardized nursing and pharmacy students caring for a trained standardized asthma patient. Findings: Pre- versus post-iOSTE survey data showed statistically significant improvements in all self-confidence related items, including the following abilities: precept students from different disciplines (p=0.004), facilitate a simulation activity (p=0.001), conduct the debriefing process (p<0.001), and discuss with students the IPE core competencies (p=0.001). Additionally, responses to post-iOSTE survey questions assessing the learning activity showed high ratings (median=5, interquartile range=4 to 5). Pharmacy preceptors increased their teaching ability and confidence level in communicating with students from other health care professions. Summary: These findings indicate that iOSTE is a useful and well-received method for preceptor development. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The researchers mentioned that the next generation of e-learning is e-learning ecosystem. E-learning ecosystem has many advantages, in which, learners form groups, collaborate with each other and with educators, and content designed for interaction. E-learning ecosystem faces some issues. It applies teacher-student model, in which, fixed learning pathway is considered suitable for all learners. Consequently, learners are presented with limited personalized materials. E-learning ecosystem needs to merge the personalization's concept. Semantic web ontology based personalization of learning environment plays a leading role to build smart e-learning ecosystem. This paper previews a detailed study which addresses research papers that apply ontology within learning environment. Most of these studies focus on personalizing e-learning by providing learners with suitable learning objects, ignoring the other learning process components. This paper proposes and implements framework for smart e-learning ecosystem using ontology and SWRL. A new direction is proposed. This direction fosters the creation of a separate four ontologies for the personalized full learning package which is composed of learner model and all the learning process components (learning objects, learning activities and teaching methods).

The concept refers also to the smart e-learner modeling of next generation to work in smart learning environments based on adaptive learning programs and their educational outcomes including life skills - social, cultural, ethical, creativity, leadership as well as computer literacy and logical, analytical and critical thinking - that help to achieve success and recognition. Learning performance is determined mainly by training strategies. Virtualization trend of the real world is also reflected in traditional education - thus e-learning represents a natural tendency of evolution. By means of technologies and well-known educational institutions and publishers, Smart Education provide e-learning programs to meet the needs and interests of students, teachers and parents, as well. On the other hand, Smart Education can also be involved in charitable events and projects for the communities. Nowadays, educators strive to make e-learning more global, innovative, inclusive and learner-centered. In this context, SEEL can be regarded as a large perspective and a revolutionary concept based on Internet technologies of distance education, as a tendency of education in a near future and as a project of building a learning interactive community, designed for learning without boundaries.

Understanding learners' distinct learning progressions in TREs demand inquiry approaches that employ well-conceived theoretical accounts of these multiple facets. The present study investigated learners' interactions with BioWorld, a TRE developed to guide students' clinical reasoning through diagnoses of simulated patients. We applied person-oriented analytic methods to multimodal data including verbal protocols, questionnaires, and computer logs from 78 task solutions. Latent class analysis, clustering methods, and latent profile analysis followed by logistic regression analyses revealed that students' clinical diagnosis ability was positively correlated with advanced self-regulated learning behaviors, high confidence and cognitive strategy use, critical attention to experts' feedback, and their positive emotional responses to feedback. The study results have the potential to contribute to a theory-guided approach to designing TREs with a data-driven assessment of multidimensional growth. Building on the study results, we introduce and discuss an ecological learner model for assessing multidimensional learner traits which can be used to design a TRE for adaptive scaffolding.

Such a model includes a number of psychological characteristics and study preferences that describe the learner's personality traits related to learning. During the last decades, the design methods and tools for e-learning have been designed assuming specific learner models. Therefore, in the search for a learning environment suitable for as many learner models as possible, we need tools to explore -and exploit- such models. In general, the learner's characteristics can be linked to the so-called learner's learning style (which is a part of the learner model) to provide the instructor with extensive knowledge about the learner's characterization in perceiving and processing information. Numerous learning styles have been proposed in the last decades, in some cases with overlapping characteristics with the same or different names. Thus, the heterogeneity of the learning style space makes it difficult to handle customization effectively. In this paper, we introduce a Learner's Characteristics Ontology based on creating interconnections between the different learning style model dimensions and learning styles with the relevant learner's characteristics, that: (1) helps instructors to improve and personalize the learning content; (2) can recommend learning materials to learners according to their learning characteristics and preferences; (3) can provide both instructors and learners with extensive knowledge about how they can improve their teaching and learning abilities; and (4) can improve communications and interaction between humans and computers by specifying the semantics of the learning style models' characteristics.

While a range of models of supervision in practice education exists, locally in occupational therapy education a 1:1 or 2:1 educator:student model tends to be adopted. One experienced practice educator approached a local university to explore having multiple occupational therapy students on placement. Four final year occupational therapy students were placed in a paediatric setting and were supervised by one practice educator, supported by her manager. Prior to completing the placement the students did not know each other. The placement was evaluated from the student, educator, manager and service perspectives. The results identified benefits and challenges. The challenges from the educator perspective were: 1. The initial time invested to plan and prepare for the students and complete the assessment reports. The challenges as highlighted by the students included having: 1. Less 1:1 time with the dedicated educator 2. Different learning styles which therefore led to a perceived difference in experience and opportunity. However, the students highlighted many benefits, including: 1. Peer support and learning 2. Skill development and realistic preparation for practice. From the service perspective, the benefits were: 1. Increased efficiency and effectiveness 2.

This study aims to contribute towards deeper understanding the examinee’s time-spent and achievement behavior during testing according to the five personality traits by exploiting assessment analytics. Further, it aims to investigate assessment analytics appropriateness for classifying students and generating enhanced student models to guide personalization of testing services. In this study, the LAERS assessment environment and the Big Five Inventory were used to track the response times of 112 undergraduate students and to extract their personality traits respectively. Partial Least Squares was used to detect fundamental relationships between the collected data, and Supervised Learning Algorithms were used to classify students. Results indicate a positive effect of extraversion and agreeableness on goal-expectancy, a positive effect of conscientiousness on both goal-expectancy and level of certainty, and a negative effect of neuroticism and openness on level of certainty. Further, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness have statistically significant indirect impact on students’ response-times and level of achievement. Moreover, the ensemble RandomForest method provides accurate classification results, indicating that a time-spent driven description of students’ behavior could have added value towards dynamically reshaping the respective models.

The freedom given to learners in this exploration context leads to a variety of learner approaches for constructing models and makes modelling of learner behavior a challenging task. To address this issue, we propose a learner modelling mechanism for monitoring learners' actions when constructing/exploring models by modelling sequences of actions reflecting different strategies in solving a task. This is based on a modified version of case-based reasoning for problems with multiple solutions. In our formulation, approaches to explore the task are represented as sequences of simple cases linked by temporal and dependency relations, which are mapped to the learners' behavior in the system by means of appropriate similarity metrics. This paper presents the development and validation of the modelling mechanism. The model was validated in the context of an ELE for mathematical generalisation using data from classroom sessions and pedagogically-driven learning scenarios.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1163996&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Therefore, an accurate representation and prediction of student knowledge is essential. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) is a popular approach for student modeling. The structure of BKT models, however, makes it impossible to represent the hierarchy and relationships between the different skills of a learning domain. Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) on the other hand are able to represent multiple skills jointly within one model. In this work, we suggest the use of DBNs for student modeling. We introduce a constrained optimization algorithm for parameter learning of such models. We extensively evaluate and interpret the prediction accuracy of our approach on five large-scale data sets of different learning domains such as mathematics, spelling learning, and physics. We furthermore provide comparisons to previous student modeling approaches and analyze the influence of the different student modeling techniques on instructional policies. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous techniques in prediction accuracy on unseen data across all learning domains and yields meaningful instructional policies.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1164000&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Then, an extended automaton is created for each cluster based on the sequences of events found in the cluster logs. The main objective of this model is to predict the actions of new students for improving the tutoring feedback provided by an intelligent tutoring system. The proposed model has been validated using student logs collected in a 3D virtual laboratory for teaching biotechnology. As a result of this validation, we concluded that the model can provide reasonably good predictions and can support tutoring feedback that is better adapted to each student type.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1163993&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The goal of instruction was to help students learn to use simple particle models to explain states of matter and phase changes. We examined changes in students' ideas about matter, the coherence of their emerging particle models, and how classroom science discourse influenced students' learning. The study was conducted in two second grade classrooms in a rural Midwestern public school. We worked with the two teachers to help them design modeling activities for students to complement lessons from the Full Option Science System (FOSS™) science curriculum the teachers had previously used. Our data sources for student learning included individual interviews with students before and after they completed the set of Modeling in the Primary Grades (MPG) lessons, artifacts created by students during learning such as posters and science notebook entries, and videotapes of MPG lessons. Our findings suggest that second grade students who engaged in MPG model-based inquiry lessons learned to use simple particle models to describe and explain a variety of material phenomena. For example, they could use particle models to account for differences in the appearance and behavior of solids, liquids, and gases and to explain what happens to matter during phase transitions. We also found variations in how MPG teachers structured classroom discourse, and our results suggest that such variations are associated with differences in the coherence of student models. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach -Regularized logistic regression was used to create a quantitative model of problem solving performance of students that predicts whether students can solve a mathematics problem correctly based on how well they solved other problems in the past. The usefulness of the model was evaluated by comparing the predicted probability of correct problem solving to the actual problem solving performance on the data set that was not used in the model building process. Findings -The regularized logistic regression model showed a better predictive power than the standard Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model, the most frequently used quantitative model of student learning in the Educational Data Mining research. Originality/value- Providing instructional scaffolding is critical in order to facilitate student learning. However, most computer-based learning environments use heuristics or rely on the discretion of students when they determine whether instructional scaffolding needs be provided. The predictive model of problem solving performance of students can be used as a quantitative guideline that can help make a better decision on when to provide instructional supports and guidance in the computer-based learning environment, which can potentially maximize the learning outcome of students.

This competitive initiative sponsored four teams that separately developed systems that covered topics in mathematics, electronics, and dynamical systems. After the teams shared their progress at the conclusion of an 18-month period, the ONR decided to fund a joint applied project in the Navy that integrated those systems on the subject matter of electronic circuits. The University of Memphis took the lead in integrating these systems in an intelligent tutoring system called ElectronixTutor . This article describes the architecture of ElectronixTutor, the learning resources that feed into it, and the empirical findings that support the effectiveness of its constituent ITS learning resources. Results: A fully integrated ElectronixTutor was developed that included several intelligent learning resources (AutoTutor, Dragoon, LearnForm, ASSISTments, BEETLE-II) as well as texts and videos. The architecture includes a student model that has (a) a common set of knowledge components on electronic circuits to which individual learning resources contribute and (b) a record of student performance on the knowledge components as well as a set of cognitive and non-cognitive attributes. There is a recommender system that uses the student model to guide the student on a small set of sensible next steps in their training. The individual components of ElectronixTutor have shown learning gains in previous decades of research. Conclusions: The ElectronixTutor system successfully combines multiple empirically based components into one system to teach a STEM topic (electronics) to students. A prototype of this intelligent tutoring system has been developed and is currently being tested. ElectronixTutor is unique in its assembling a group of well-tested intelligent tutoring systems into a single integrated learning environment.

A recently deceased, un-embalmed donor was scanned through high-resolution computed tomography. The scan data underwent segmentation and post-processing and a range of 3D-printed anatomical models were produced. A four-stage mixed-methods study was conducted to evaluate the educational value of the models in a medical program. (1) A quantitative pre/post-test to assess change in learner knowledge following 3D-printed model usage in a small group tutorial; (2) student focus group (3) a qualitative student questionnaire regarding personal student model usage (4) teaching faculty evaluation. The use of 3D-printed models in small-group anatomy teaching session resulted in a significant increase in knowledge (P = 0.0001) when compared to didactic 2D-image based teaching methods. Student focus groups yielded six key themes regarding the use of 3D-printed anatomical models: model properties, teaching integration, resource integration, assessment, clinical imaging, and pathology and anatomical variation. Questionnaires detailed how students used the models in the home environment and integrated them with anatomical learning resources such as textbooks and anatomy lectures. In conclusion, 3D-printed anatomical models can be successfully produced from the CT data set of a recently deceased donor. These models can be used in anatomy education as a teaching tool in their own right, as well as a method for augmenting the curriculum and complementing established learning modalities, such as dissection-based teaching.

The integration of semantic web technologies in knowledge management and e-learning structure, assure the semantic interoperability. This paper proposes an environment of e-learning based on new semantic technologies able to manage the process of building personalized educational content for training university hospital managers. The necessity of development of such a system results from the competence requirements for the specialists of human resources management (HRM) in the medical system. These goals are achieved using ontologies in implementing the personalized process of learning and in modelling the learning flow. Ontologies are used to model student profile, educational domain and learning process. These models are implemented into an intelligent learning Web platform. This ontology-based platform offers the specific tools to implement a new mechanism to obtain the relevant information from Internet. The implementation of personalization in the e-learning system is achieved starting from the student model to determine the knowledge level and to identify their preferences and interests. The students receive the learning material according to their profile, learning style, initial knowledge and education needs. Learning style and student's profile are the most important parameters in determining individual differences and define the adaptive learning environments. The e-learning prototype system contributes to increase the performance, skills and capacity to assess the health managers, proposes an automatized search method for the desired and needed information in the identified specific professional domain.

Design/methodology/approach: Mixed-methods (qualitative-quantitative) approach has been used. First, to develop the primary framework, papers were content-analyzed. Then, to validate the results of the content analysis, responses of the questionnaires distributed among students and teachers at five virtual universities in Iran were analyzed. Findings: VALEs have the value co-creation potential. The students and teachers in this sample identified and confirmed three dimensions including partnership requirements (including organizational capabilities, structural requirement, individual competencies, motivational factors and resources), collaborative learning services (including IT infrastructure, common services and educational services) and social networks. The foundation of value co-creation is a partnership requirement. Collaborative learning services are flexible services that redesign methods and curriculum and promote deep learning among students. In addition, the wide use of social networks enables dialogue, communication, participation and establishment of virtual learning groups. Practical implications: By means of the suggested framework, it is possible to achieve value co-creation in VALEs. Originality/value: The paper presents outcomes of the research that is focused on technical, human and organizational aspects for value co-creation in VALEs that have not been much discussed previously.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1172600&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Over the years, the interest of building learning systems has migrated from individual learning on content knowledge to community learning as the result of the recent Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 sociotechnological wave. The paper describes the work that was done to develop the learning system in both situations - content knowledge and social knowledge where the experiences mainly in capturing the knowledge and representing them are different. The paper signifies the differences in terms of developing experiences and methodologies for building the content knowledge and social knowledge based on the previous works. The finding of the previous works tells that context knowledge is derived from structured sources and also referred to single-sourced expertise while the social knowledge is more challenging due to its unknown structure of knowledge as well as may derive from various experts.

This paper introduces the Math Story Problem Tutor (MAST), a Web-based intelligent tutoring system for probability story problems, which is able to generate problems of different contexts, types and difficulty levels for self-paced learning. Constraints in MAST are specified at a lowlevel of granularity to allow fine-grained diagnosis of the student error. Furthermore, MAST extends CBM to address errors due to misunderstanding of the narrative story. It can locate and highlight keywords that may have been overlooked or misunderstood leading to an error. This is achieved by utilizing the roles and syntaxes of the problem segments and the semantic descriptions of the keywords that are defined through the Natural Language Generation (NLG) methods deployed in the story problem generation. MAST also integrates CBM with scaffolding questions and feedback to provide various forms of help and guidance to the student. This allows the student to discover and correct any errors in his/her solution. The tutoring effect of MAST has been evaluated empirically using different tests (paired samples t-test, normalized knowledge gain, Mann-Whitney U test and power learning curves). The results demonstrated a positive effect of MAST on improving the exam scores and the normalized knowledge gain. Additionally, keyword highlighting of errors integrated in MAST has been shown to speed up learning and improve reduction of average percentage of violated constraints along the learning curve. This suggests that using various forms of assistance can help speedup learning and that welldesigned tutoring systems providing relevant help can be superior to traditional approaches.

To aid student understanding of calculus concepts, a multidisciplinary team from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology created four laboratories to accompany Calculus I instruction. The team worked together developing learning objectives, appropriate concepts, and physical implementations. Laboratory 1 explored differentiation and a Resistor-Inductor circuit. Students learned to build a simple circuit on a breadboard and used an oscilloscope to measure the response of the circuit to a static and varying signal. Laboratory 2 investigated time-varying weight. Students measured the weight of water in a bucket as the bucket filled and then released water. Laboratory 3 modeled the infusion of medicine into a patient using a saline solution. Students examined both a continuous infusion and an infusion pulse and determined time constants for the process. Laboratory 4 required students to build a Resistor-Capacitor circuit and measure voltages. Students also determined gain and phase shift as a function of frequency. Initial observations indicate that students enjoy the laboratory setting. In order to assess the impact of the addition of laboratories, final exam scores from the laboratory section will be compared with final exam scores from the traditional section. In addition, faculty in the introductory instrumentation course will compare preparation of students in the new math class to students from the traditional math classes.

Specifically, the adaptation and personalization of gaming and learning activities, which is considered one of key features to assure appropriate learning, requires a robust and theory grounded assessment. This establishes a basis for the game, as an autonomous entity, to gain a certain level of understanding of the individual learners / players. A second aspect in the context of game-based assessment is assessment with games. Over the past years, digital games have been identified as an ideal vehicle to assess various types of aptitude (such as competencies) but also further characteristics such as personality traits. Val Shute, in her influential work, often argues that assessment and personalization is often too simplified, abstract, and decontextualized to suit the needs of successful individual learning support. In this contribution, I want to highlight the links of game-based assessment to techniques of Learning Analytics and psychometric methodologies. I present a combinatorial, structural approach to the measurement of competencies and individual learning paths based on Knowledge Space Theory, extended by Micro Adaptivity, a well-elaborated approach to learner modelling and in-game adaptation. I complement the ideas of structural assessment models with psychometric considerations, in particular the aspects of assessment accuracy, reliability, and validity. The idea is to capitalize on the methodological accuracy of Item Response Theory scaling, where a number of items are arranged on a linear dimension of ""difficulty"" and improve the accuracy of the multi-dimensional micro adaptive assessment models.

One of the design principles of the project is to implement a level of adaptivity into the game, so that the difficulty of the mathematical content adapts to the player's current level of arithmetic fluency. A learner model has been developed to enable the game to use previous gameplay performance to calculate the player's current level of arithmetic fluency, and thereby provide new tasks at an appropriate level of difficulty. A second design principle is to decouple the mathematical difficulty from gameplay rewards, so that progress in the game is achieved through time and effort rather that solely as a result of mathematical achievement. We predict that these two design principles will produce games that are motivating and help players to experience flow. This paper describes and discusses our adaptive implementation, and our approach to decoupling of mathematical learning from rewards. We evaluate the success of the game to date and consider scope for potential development and improvement. We also show how the analytical data produced by the learner model has been used to identify unhelpful in-game behaviours and adapt the game design. A future goal of the project is to explore whether the adaptivity of the learner model can be expanded to include gameplay ability (including elements hand-eye coordination and response times) and allow for separate dynamic adjustment of (non-mathematical) difficulty. We are particularly interested in investigating the affordances of such a ""two-axis"" flow in the game.

The challenge is: the evaluation of usability of e-learning courses before the large-scale implementation. With this aim, we combine knowledge elements explored from logged learners behavior data and cognitive theories to formulate a computer model for Virtual Student's evolution. We assume that some of the brains energetic expenses in learning and memorization are due to energy-extraction skills from cognitive abilities, knowledge, information, etc. We also assume that the Virtual Student model can perform energy flow modeling by extracting energy from the environmental learning objects and losing the power in a tedious learning process. The research shows that on a Virtual Student's cognitive energy flow model based approach can potentially improve the model compliance with real student's behavior model and can be applied to predictive analytics classification problems in both inexpensive small and large-scale applications.

Thus the Autonomous Learner Model (ALM) is a key to demonstrate responsibility for Self-learning, develop positive self-esteem, increase knowledge in a variety of areas, develop decision-making, and problem-solving skills, imbibe certain skills to interact with everyone associated with students like friends, siblings, adults, parents, develop logical and creative thinking skills, develop skills to interact effectively with peers, siblings, parents, and other adults, develop critical and creative thinking skills, and thus take initiative of one's learning by being independent and lifelong learners. The present study aimed to study the effect of Autonomous Learner Model and Self-esteem of students studying in Class IX of Mangaluru Taluk. The study follows a Post-test only equivalent group design of research with simple random sampling technique, where a population of five hundred students were selected, out of which a representative sample of sixty students from a Private Secondary School of Mangaluru Taluk were selected. A rating scale on Self-esteem prepared by the researcher was used for the students for finding both negative and positive feelings about oneself. The paper is concluded with significant findings related to this issue and suggestions related to modifications on desirable lines. This research found out that the two instructional methods -- Autonomous Learner Model and Traditional Method differed in their effects on Self-esteem of Secondary School Students. Autonomous Learner Model is significantly more effective than Traditional Method with respect to Self-esteem of secondary school students after partialling out the effect of Pre-Achievement. Levels of achievement have significant effect on developing Self-esteem among secondary school students and the Interaction effects of Autonomous Learner Model and Levels of Achievement has a significant effect on Self-esteem among secondary school students.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1269398&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Our work expands on [4], [5] in several ways: (1) We develop a novel student model in which the teacher's actions can ""partially"" eliminate hypotheses about the curriculum. (2) With our student model, inference can be conducted ""analytically"" rather than numerically, thus allowing computationally efficient planning to optimize learning.

Sixty undergraduate students received expository instruction about natural selection, which presented the canonical, scientifically accepted account in detail. Two-third of these received CEC&C feedback on their self-generated solutions to open-ended test items. Students either received this feedback on their pretest solutions (prior to instruction), or on their immediate posttest solutions (following instruction). Students in the control condition only received the correct canonical answers to the immediate post-test items and compared these with their own solutions autonomously. Conceptual understanding on transfer items was assessed after 1 week. Results showed that students in the CEC&C feedback conditions outperformed control students. Timing of feedback did not affect learning, however. These findings add to accumulating evidence from different lines of research on the importance of instructional support that explicitly compares and contrasts between erroneous student models and canonical models in conceptual change tasks.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1179621&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Firstly, on the basis of the actual demand of ICAI system, the theoretical basis and development principle of intelligent tutoring system were expounded, and the system construction of student model and teacher model was studied. Secondly, the implementation of the quantitative assessment of cognitive ability and the teaching strategy base in DCB-ITS student model were studied and the implementation of the intelligent tutoring system was analyzed. Finally, in order to test the efficiency of the system, we carried through an empirical study. A survey to 209 college teachers was conducted, the results show that teachers who make use of the intelligent tutoring system during the teaching activities report higher scores of teaching self-efficacy, which indicates that compared with the traditional teaching model, the computer aided intelligent teaching model is of great help for teachers in making them feel more confident about teaching effectively.

We thoroughly analyse several mastery criteria for the basic case of a single well-specified knowledge component. For the analysis we use experiments with both simulated and real data. The results show that the choice of data sources used for mastery decision and the setting of thresholds are more important than the choice of a learner modelling technique. We argue that a simple exponential moving average method is a suitable technique for mastery criterion and discuss techniques for the choice of a mastery threshold.

This approach is known to prompt reflection, facilitate planning and navigation. Open Learner Models may show different levels of detail of the underlying learner model, and may structure the information differently. However, a trade-off exists between useful information and the complexity of the information. This paper investigates whether offering richer information is assessed positively by learners and results in more effective support for learning tasks. An interview pre-study revealed which information within the complex learner model is of interest. A controlled user study examined six alternative visualisation prototypes of varying complexity and resulted in the implementation of one of the designs. A second controlled study involved students interacting with variations of the visualisation while searching for suitable learning material, and revealed the value of the design alternative and its variations. The work contributes to developing complex open learner models by stressing the need to balance complexity and support. It also suggests that the expressiveness of open learner models can be improved with visual elements that strategically summarise the complex information being displayed in detail.

We call this model dAFM, based on augmentation of the original Additive Factors Model (AFM), whose calculations and constraints we show can be exactly replicated within the framework of neural networks. In order to parameterize the Q-matrix definition in the model, the associations between questions and knowledge components (KC) need to be represented by adjustable weights. Furthermore, student KC opportunity counts, instead of serving as fixed inputs, need to be calculated dynamically as the Q-matrix changes during training. We describe our solutions to these two modeling challenges and evaluate several variants of our fully realized model on datasets from the Cognitive Tutor and ASSISTments. We compare learning the Q-matrix from scratch vs. refining an expert specified KC model and evaluate various procedures for refinement. In our quantitative predictive analysis, we find that dAFM learns a better generalizing Q-matrix than the original expert model in all our primary datasets. Using a development set, we also find that the dAFM Q-matrix is superior to KC representations extracted from trained Deep Knowledge Tracing and skip-gram models. Examples are shown of questions whose fit was improved by dAFM with depictions of their original and refined KC associations. We consistently find in our experiments that our dAFM variant which attempted to learn the Q-matrix from scratch underperformed models which started with an expert defined Q-matrix that was then refined. This observation continues a theme in EDM of utility found in the enduring value of expert domain knowledge enhanced through data-driven refinement.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1195509&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

In this work, we directly compared three models: BKT, its variant Intervention-BKT (IBKT), and LSTM, on two types of student modeling tasks: post-test scores prediction and learning gains prediction. Additionally, while previous work on student learning has often used skill/knowledge components identified by domain experts, we incorporated an automatic skill discovery method (SK), which includes a nonparametric prior over the exercise-skill assignments, to all three models. Thus, we explored a total of six models: BKT, BKT+SK, IBKT, IBKT+SK, LSTM, and LSTM+SK. Two training datasets were employed, one was collected from a natural language physics intelligent tutoring system named Cordillera, and the other was from a standard probability intelligent tutoring system named Pyrenees. Overall, our results showed that BKT and BKT+SK outperformed the others on predicting post-test scores, whereas LSTM and LSTM+SK achieved the highest accuracy, F1-measure, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) on predicting learning gains. Furthermore, we demonstrated that by combining SK with the BKT model, BKT+SK could reliably predict post-test scores using only the earliest 50% of the entire training sequences. For learning gain early prediction, using the earliest 70% of the entire sequences, LSTM can deliver a comparable prediction as using the entire training sequences. The findings yield a learning environment that can foretell students' performance and learning gains early, and can render adaptive pedagogical strategy accordingly.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1195512&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

We will explore how mathematical modeling bridges equity and social community in teaching and learning mathematics for all students. Exemplar tasks that emphasized local contexts and tapped into students' funds of knowledge and student artifacts will be shared to illustrate the child's perspective and the developmental progression. These topics will facilitate group discussions exploring the learning progression for mathematical modeling thinking and habits of mind that can develop for emergent mathematical modelers from an early grade.

Such assessments could ideally be useful in multiple phases of the instructional process by providing information to learners, teachers, and other stakeholders because the technologies allow for efficiencies of task presentation, response gathering, scoring, storing data, and returning results. With the goal of understanding the development costs required to achieve such benefits, the project used an evidence-centered design (ECD) framework to create a prototype assessment for ELL middle school students. In addition to describing the ECD process, the report describes how the project mandate helped to focus the complex processes of ECD and how the activities of ECD came into play in sketching plans for the validity argument. The ECD process of domain analysis uncovered perspectives on tablet use in middle schools as well as theoretical perspectives for conceptualizing the tablet users' abilities and learning. Findings included a range of uses of mobile technologies in middle school classrooms in 2013, with little uniformity in practices. Based on analysis of common elements in tablet-based communication and learning, a framework for characterizing the relevant strategies and abilities was developed. Findings served in the domain modeling process of defining task design patterns, which in turn provided the basis for planning the conceptual assessment framework (CAF). The CAF also drew upon domain analysis findings, which suggested the concepts required for defining a student model (what is to be inferred about the test taker), an evidence model (the basis for making the inference), and the task model (the features of tasks required for eliciting relevant performance). The assessment implementation process produced a working prototype that served in usability testing and gathering feedback from middle school teachers. The report describes how ECD guides the design of tablet-based formative assessment tasks that take into account the constructs to be measured and the learning that should result from test taking. The evaluation of the project is undertaken in view of the goal of ECD to design test tasks in a manner that serves in the argument for their use. Success is therefore evaluated in part by an analysis of the quality of content it supplied for an interpretation/use argument for the assessment. Overall, the project highlights include (a) the demonstration of how a mandate delimits the ECD processes; (b) the construct framework encompassing both the linguistic and nonlinguistic resources used to create meaning in a digital environment; (c) the approach used for analysis of a domain with emerging, shifting, and variously used technologies; and (d) the use of an interpretation/use argument in the appraisal of an ECD test design.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1202815&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Studies on student clustering are abundant; however, a system for clustering metacognitive that considers proper analysis technique of Likert-scaled dataset is unavailable. This article proposes a student clustering method which uses a new Likert scale analysis. It is performed on a dataset collected from 81 students of a vocational high school. The performance was compared to previous methods; enhancement is shown by higher silhouette-index and strong correlation with work readiness score. To evaluate the clustering effectiveness, it is implemented on an e-learning system to generate adaptive instructions. The e-learning system is a supplement for fundamental programming course in the school. The t-test result shows that learning gain of experiment group is significantly higher that of the control group. Therefore, the proposed method is effective in improving students' learning quality.

This article presents a method for predicting the point at which a student will reach skill mastery within an adaptive learning system, based on current approaches to estimating student knowledge.

Indeed, the personalization of the learning process for every user is needed to increase the student satisfaction and learning efficiency. Nevertheless, the number of students who give up their learning process cannot be neglected. Therefore, it is mandatory to establish an efficient way to assess the level of personalization in such systems. In fact, assessing represents the evolution's key in every personalized application and especially for the e-learning systems. Besides, when the e-learning system can decipher the student personality, the student learning process will be stabilized, and the dropout rate will be decreased. In this context, we propose to evaluate the personalization process in an e-learning platform using an intelligent referential system based on agents. It evaluates any recommendation made by the e-learning platform based on a comparison. We compare the personalized service of the e-learning system and those provided by our referential system. Therefore, our purpose consists in increasing the efficiency of the proposed system to obtain a significant assessment result; precisely, the aim is to improve the outcomes of every algorithm used in each defined agent. This paper deals with the intelligent agent 'Mod-Knowledge' responsible for analyzing the student interaction to trace the student knowledge state. The originality of this agent is that it treats the external and the internal student interactions using machine learning algorithms to obtain a complete view of the student knowledge state. The validation of this contribution is done with experiments showing that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing ones.

Improvements on earlier models have shown that separate predictors for prior successes, failures, and recent performance further improve fit while remaining interpretable. However, students who engage in ""gaming"" or other off-task behaviors may reduce the predictiveness of learner models that treat counts of prior performance equivalently across gaming and non-gaming student populations. The present research evaluated how sub-groups of students that varied in their potential gaming behavior were differently fit by a logistic learner model, and whether any observed differences between sub-groups could inspire the creation of new predictors that might improve model fit. Student data extracted from a college-level online learning application were clustered according to speed and accuracy using Gaussian mixture modeling. Distinct clusters were found, with similar cluster patterns detected in three separate datasets. Subsequently, each cluster was separately fit to a Performance Factors Analysis model (PFA). Significantly different parameter coefficients across clusters implied that students more likely to have been gaming benefitted less from prior failures. These differences inspired new and modified predictors that were found to improve overall model fit - an improvement that varied in magnitude across clusters. The present findings indicate that incorporating trial duration into counts of prior failures can improve the predictive power of learning models.

The adaptation and hence the benefits of an ITS can be improved by detecting and responding to students' affective states. In prior work, we have created and validated a theory-driven model for detecting students' frustration, as well as identifying its causes as students interact with the ITS. In this paper, we present a strategy to respond to students' frustration by offering motivational messages that address different causes of frustration. Based on attribution theory, these messages are created to praise the student's effort, attribute the results to the identified cause, show sympathy for failure or obtain feedback from the students. We implemented our approach in three schools where students interacted with the ITS. Data from 188 students from the three schools collected across two weeks was used for our analysis. The results suggest that the frustration instances reduced significantly statistically (p < 0.05), due to the motivational messages. This study suggests that motivational messages that use attribution theory and address the reason for frustration reduce the number of frustration instances per session.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1212498&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

An adaptive learning environment model can be subdivided into a learner model, domain model, instructional model and adaptive engine. Personal traits comprise part of the components in a learner model and can be identified either explicitly or implicitly in an adaptive learning environment. In such an environment, the e-learning system should adapt to a learner's needs. However, even though academic research on adaptive learning environments has increased, the field lacks a comprehensive literature analysis of learners' personal traits in these environments. This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify the most commonly used personal traits in modelling the learner and the existing techniques suitable for identifying personal traits in an adaptive learning environment. A total of 140 articles spanning the years 2010–2017 are initially reviewed, from which 78 are selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria relevant to this study. This study provides an overview of learners' personal traits and the techniques used to identify them to provide a basis for improving adaptive learning environments. The findings indicate that most of the previous works used a learning style from the cognition learning domain category to model individual personal traits, while the computer-based detection technique was commonly applied to identify a learner's personal traits in adaptive learning environments. This study reveals the common learner characteristics used to develop learner models and the techniques for implementing such models. The findings of this paper can guide other researchers to recognise various personal traits and the identification technique for further studies, as well as assist developers in the development of the adaptive learning system. Highlights • Comprehensive literature on identification of learner's characteristics. • The correlation between a specific personal trait and learning object. • Learner model implementation and enhancement techniques. • Impact of integrating personal traits in progressive learning.

Recently large scale efforts have been devoted toward assessing CPS skills, but there are no agreed upon guiding principles for assessment of this complex construct, particularly for assessment in digital performance situations. There are notable challenges in conceptualizing the complex construct and extracting evidence of CPS skills from large streams of data in digital contexts such as games and simulations. In the current paper, we discuss how the in-task assessment framework (I-TAF), a framework informed by evidence-centered design, can provide guiding principles for the assessment of CPS in these contexts. We give specific attention to one aspect of I-TAF, ontologies, and describe how they can be used to instantiate the student model in evidence-centered design which lays out what we wish to measure in a principled way. We further discuss how ontologies can serve as an anchor representation for other components of assessment such as scoring rubrics, evidence identification, and task design.

Technically, imbalanced data resource can cause more difficulties or limitations for learning algorithms to distinguish different classes, while data with labeling errors can lead to an unreasonable problem formulation due to incorrect hypotheses. Indeed, noise and class imbalance are pervasive problems in the domain of educational data analytics. This study aims at developing improved randomized learning algorithms by investigating a novel type of cost function that focuses on the combined effects of class imbalance and class noise. Instead of concerning these uncertainty issues isolation, we present a convex combination of robust and imbalanced modelling objectives, contributing to a generalized formulation of weighted least squares problems by which the improved randomized learner models can be built. Our experimental study on several educational data classification tasks have verified the advantages of our proposed algorithms, in comparison with some existing methods that either takes no account of class imbalance and labeling errors, or merely consider one specific aspect in problem-solving.

We analyzed models made by middle school students who had a year of intensive model-based instruction. These models were made to explain a familiar but unstudied biological phenomenon: late onset muscle pain. Students were provided with three pieces of evidence related to this phenomenon and asked to construct a model to account for this evidence. Findings indicate that domain-specific resources play a significant role in the extent to which the models accounted for provided evidence. On the other hand, familiarity with the situation appeared to contribute to the mechanistic character of models. Our results indicate that modeling strategies alone are insufficient for the development of a mechanistic model that accounts for provided evidence and that, while learners can develop a tentative model with a basic familiarity of the situation, scaffolding certain domain-specific knowledge is necessary to assist students with incorporating evidence in modeling tasks.

The improvement of safety performance of construction workers heavily lies in safety training, and training technologies, materials and organisations. However, the traditional one-size-fit-all safety training does not cater for the needs of heterogeneous workers. Personalised training may proffer a better solution for heterogeneous workers in the construction sector. To understand the rationale of personalised training, this study formulated a learner model that can capture and evaluate the learning abilities of individual workers. Methodically, a survey on 170 construction workers was conducted, and evidenced that they were heterogeneous in safety training motivation, established knowledge, and emotions during the knowledge acquisition process; and were vulnerable to the model effect and convenience effect during the knowledge application process. The results also showed that workers generally perceived safety training as a mandatory requirement, rather than inherently motivated; emotional changes was the most influencing factor in the knowledge acquisition process; about 40% of the workers were strongly vulnerable to the model effect and convenience effect; and 18% of the workers needed to improve their ability of knowledge acquisition and knowledge application. The correlation analysis and t -test indicated that age, year of experience, trade, project type, organisation type and site environment influenced workers' learning characteristics and abilities; which lead to the varied levels of safety understanding, awareness and performance. It was also concluded that the construction workers had unique characteristics in their safety learning process and the concept of adapted safety learning could potentially improve the efficiency of safety training.

Methods: Qualitative data were gathered from focus groups/interviews with volunteer participants to elicit in-depth perceptions about experiences of practice placement. Data were transcribed, verbatim, and manually coded and analysed by the researcher using the applied research methodology of framework analysis, enabling the investigation of the a priori theme 'practice placement model', and recommendations were made for improvement. Results: Two radiotherapy placement models are confirmed, i.e. the single student model, and the paired student model, and advantages and disadvantages are identified for each. Study findings suggest that neither radiotherapy model is superior to the other in terms of placement education and experience. Previous and current experience of either model appears to bias students and practice educators towards that model, despite recognition of its disadvantages. Conclusion: The experiences of students and practice educators using the radiotherapy models are consistent with the experiences of other AHPs and nursing using similar practice placement models. It is recommended that all students should have access to peer-assisted learning on placement to improve critical thinking skills, to enable time for reflection, and to consolidate learning.

Specifically, it facilitates research in developing predictive models that predict whether the first job of a student out of college belongs to a STEM (the acronym for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) field. This is based on the student's learning history on the ASSISTments blended learning platform in the form of extensive clickstream data gathered during the middle school years. To tackle this challenge, we first estimate the expected knowledge state of students with respect to different mathematical skills using a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model and an enhanced DKT (DKT+) model. We then combine the features corresponding to the DKT/DKT+ expected knowledge state with other features extracted directly from the student profile in the dataset to train several machine learning models for the STEM/non-STEM job prediction. Our experiments show that models trained with the combined features generally perform better than the models trained with the student profile alone. Detailed analysis on the student's knowledge state reveals that, when compared with non-STEM students, STEM students generally show a higher mastery level and a higher learning gain in mathematics.

With many countries now implementing multilingual educational initiatives in schools, there is a need to reconfigure training programs and encourage teachers to develop a multilingual identity so that they can better promote multilingualism among their students. At present, monolingual ideologies dominate the language education landscape, particularly disadvantaging non-native speaker teachers (NNSTs), who are proficient multilinguals by default and who might best embody the successful language learner model for emergent multilinguals. Studies on NNSTs, however, have traditionally focused on their status as deficient native speakers instead of exploring their multilinguality, although this has started to change in recent years. This study represents a critical review of empirical studies (n = 84) from 2009–2018 that reflect this change. The review indicates that a growing number of studies have started to document NNSTs' unique affordances and multilingual practices in the classroom globally, that NNSTs can develop a reactive multilingual identity in response to native-speakerism, and that learners, when engaged by researchers, do recognize the multilingual affordances of NNSTs. The study's findings should contribute to the growing body of research on multilingual teacher identity, affordances, and practices, especially as this concerns NNSTs.

Schools are sites of negotiation of what it means to be ''smart"", and which students are viewed as smart. This is a pertinent problem for educational scholars, teacher educators, and teachers, because struggles concerning smartness foster social inequity. While much research accentuates the inequity that occurs when those students who do not fit the ""smart"" category are marginalized, the inequities that emerge when teachers prefer the smart student have not received much scholarly attention. Drawing on linguistic ethnographic fieldwork in a primary school in Copenhagen, Denmark, this paper explores how one student, over the course of two years and two months, comes to inhabit the ""smart"" role, and must then cope with being favoured by the teachers and ostracised by peers. Dual pressures such as these have implications for education and research.

The goal of the ITS is to teach the use of punctuation in Turkish. The proposed ITS includes two student models, i.e., an overlay student model and a CBM. The student modeler in the CBM records each mistake a student make when answering questions in the system. Immediate feedback and hints are provided based on the recorded mistakes. In addition, moreover the level of students' learning of the usage of punctuation marks is determined and overlay student model is updated according to the mistakes. If the student cannot provide the correct answer relative to the desired learning level after a specified number of attempts, this information is recorded by the overlay student model. Students can study the pages and attempt to answer the questions again. For determining the level of learning MYCIN certainty factor, the number of times the student takes for answering the question and fuzzy logic decision system are used. Crowded classes make it difficult for teachers to evaluate all student answers and provide individual feedback. The proposed ITS identifies student mistakes and provides feedback immediately. In addition, the ITS analyzes mistakes to determine the student's learning gaps relative to specific topics and concepts. Learning to use punctuation correctly is valuable; thus, the proposed ITS model is important and worthwhile.

Of 477 student respondents, the most frequently indicated advocacy/public policy activity engaged in was voting (56%). The greatest benefit to advocacy was indicated as creating public awareness, while the most prevalent barrier reported was lack of familiarity with the legislation process. Less than one third of students reported receiving any training; however, training and the number of training sources were associated with greater involvement (p < .05). Comparisons by academic classification indicated that graduate students participated in more advocacy activities and reported significantly more benefits, barriers, knowledge, and self-efficacy compared with undergraduates. Regression analysis indicated that knowledge, self-efficacy, perceived benefits, and total number of training sources were significant predictors of advocacy involvement in both graduate and undergraduate student models, with age also contributing significantly to the graduate student model.

However, effective learning‐in‐action also depends on the extent to which students are active‐in‐thinking, making meaning of their learning experience. A critical component of any technology to support active thinking is the ability to ascertain whether (or to what extent) students have succeeded in internalizing the disciplinary strategies, norms of thinking, discourse practices and habits of mind that characterize deep understanding in a domain. This presents what we call a dilemma of modeling‐in‐context: teachers routinely analyze this kind of thinking for small numbers of students in activities they create or customize for the needs of their students; however, doing so at scale and in real‐time requires some automated processes for modeling student work. Current techniques for developing models that reflect specific pedagogical activities and learning objectives that a teacher might create require either more expertise or more time than teachers have. In this paper, we examine a theoretical approach to addressing the problem of modeling active thinking in its pedagogical context that uses teacher‐created rubrics to generate models of student work. The results of this examination show how appropriately constructed learning technologies can enable teachers to develop custom automated rubrics for modeling active thinking and meaning‐making from the records of students' dialogic work. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Many immersive educational technologies, such as digital games and simulations, enable students to take consequential action in a realistic context and to interact with peers, mentors and pedagogical agents. Such technologies help students to be active‐in‐thinking: engaging deeply with, reflecting on and otherwise making meaning of their learning experience.There are now many immersive educational technologies with integrated authoring tools that enable teachers to customize the learning experience with relative ease, reducing barriers to adoption and improving student learning.Educational technologies that support learning‐in‐action typically contain student models that operate in real‐time to control the behavior of pedagogical agents, deliver just‐in‐time interventions, select an appropriate content or otherwise measure and promote active thinking, but these student models may not work appropriately if teachers customize the learning experience.Much as there are authoring tools that allow teachers to customize the curriculum of a given learning technology, there is a need for authoring tools that allow teachers to customize the associated student models as well.What this paper adds This paper presents a novel, rubric‐based approach to develop automated student models for new activities that teachers develop in digital learning environments that promote active thinking.Our approach combines machine learning techniques with teacher expertise, allowing teachers to participate in the design of automated student models of active thinking that with further development could be scaled by leveraging their skills in rubric development.Our results show that a rubric‐based approach can outperform a machine learning approach in this context. More importantly, in some cases, the rubric‐based approach can produce reliable automated models based on the information that a teacher can easily provide.Implications for practice and/or policy If integrated into authoring tools, the rubric‐based approach could allow teachers to participate in the design of automated models for educational technologies customized to their instructional needs.Through this design process, teachers could develop a better understanding of how the automated modeling system works, which in turn could increase the adoption of educational technologies that promote active thinking.Because the rubric‐based approach enables teachers to identify key connections among concepts relevant to the pedagogical context, rather than general concepts or linguistic features, it is more likely to facilitate targeted feedback to help promote the development of active thinking.

To this aim, we systematically reviewed the literature of the last three decades and found 67 articles, of which only a sample of 15 were considered. Based on the findings, we performed a narrative analysis of the studies concerning technological features of OLMs that cater to the three main aspects concerning self‐regulated learning, namely, cognition, metacognition and motivation. Our analysis of the literature confirmed that these three aspects are all subject to some measure of influence. In mutually interacting, these three components support learners to reach a better understanding of their learning process. Specifically, it seems that mostly all three type of OLMs, inspectable, negotiable, and co‐operative, with simple and complex graphical presentation of their learner models and capacity to colour‐code and compare—alike appear optimal for augmenting cognition, metacognition, and motivation. They seemingly do so through offering a wealth of techniques pertaining to knowledge, difficulties, and misconception visualization. The results presented suggest that OLMs have a positive impact on learners' active thinking regarding their learning process. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Several educational environments have been enhanced with open learner models (OLMs) with the aim of supporting learners.OLM seems to be a potential avenue for improving higher education by supporting learners' active thinking about their learning process by enhancing self‐regulated learning.Despite growing interest in OLMs, there has yet to be any effort to systematically review current research studies investigating their potential to promote self‐regulated learning.What this paper adds All type of OLMs, with their varied visualization features, to some extent are useful for promoting cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational components of self‐regulated learning.In mutually interacting, the three components of self‐regulated learning support learners to reach a better understanding of their learning process, and thereby promoting active thinking.Implications for practice and/or policy We suggest that practitioners must first grasp the possibilities for the cultivation of self‐regulated learning contained in the particular features of each OLM, and then add this insight to their own expertise in order to best integrate them for supporting students' active thinking.While a number of specific features of OLMs seem pertinent to cultivating one particular element of self‐regulated learning, there remains the chance that, through the interaction of cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational tactics, these features could in fact make a more holistic and general contribution. This supports learners to move from active‐in‐behaviour to active‐in‐thinking activities in digital learning environments.

However, the promise will not be achieved simply by AI and Machine Learning researchers developing innovative models that more accurately predict labeled data. As AI advances, modeling techniques and the models they produce are getting increasingly complex, often involving tens of thousands of parameters or more. Though strides towards interpretation of complex models are being made in core machine learning communities, it remains true in these cases of ""black box"" modeling that research teams may have little possibility to peer inside to try understand how, why, or even whether such models will work when applied beyond the data on which they were built. Rather than relying on AI expertise alone, we suggest that learning engineering teams bring interdisciplinary expertise to bear to develop explanatory learner models that provide interpretable and actionable insights in addition to accurate prediction. We describe examples that illustrate use of different kinds of data (eg, click stream and discourse data) in different course content (eg, math and writing) and toward different goals (eg, improving student models and generating actionable feedback). We recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Researchers in learning analytics and educational data mining have been successful in creating innovative models of data that optimize prediction.Some of these models produce scientific or practical insights and fewer have been put into use and demonstrated to enhance student learning.What this paper adds We provide examples of development of explanatory models of learners that not only accurately predict data but also provide scientific insights and yield practical outcomes.In particular, researchers with expertise in cognitive science and math education content use AI‐based data analytics to discover previously unrecognized barriers to geometry student learning. They use model‐derived insights to redesign an online tutoring system and ""close‐the‐loop"" by experimentally demonstrating that the new system produces better student learning than the original.Implications for practice and/or policy We define explanatory learning models and provide an articulation of a process for generating them that involves interdisciplinary teams employing human–computer interaction and learning engineering methods.Based on our experiences, we recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning.

We took IMS-LIP, IMSACCLIP and IMS-RDCEO standards into consideration and incorporated their characteristics to our proposed learner model so that it conforms to international standards. Moreover, the suggested learner model takes advantage of the semantic web technologies that offer a better data organization, indexing and management and ensures the reusability, the interoperability and the extensibility of this model. Furthermore, due to the use of ontologies, the metadata about a learner can be used by a wide range of personalization techniques to provide more accurate customization.

To do so, this work draws on two organizing frameworks that have heretofore not been associated: evidence-centered design, and the distinction between greater and lesser statistics. Overlaying these frameworks leads to a conceptualization of greater and lesser ""psychometrics."" This provides a conceptual space for articulating the ways in which response process data have implications for lesser psychometrics through measurement models, as well as greater psychometrics through student models, task models, and the social and personal contexts in which assessment takes place. To illustrate the key points and motivate discussions of where future research is needed, I draw from experiences with three assessments that have involved response process data: a task assessing the measurement of geometric area, a performance-based assessment of computer networking, and an educational video game targeting rational number addition.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1272058&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Although critical reading, which is the main medium for accessing the right knowledge, is defined as a sub-category for creative reading in which high cognitive processes are involved, the connection between these has not been clearly put forward. This study aimed at examining the effect of critical reading skills of 5th grade learners on their evaluation skills of creative reading process, and the role of gender in this effect through structural equation modelling. Research Methods: The study was supported by relational screening model. The study group was formed by simple random sampling and composed of 265 5th grade learners. The data were collected through the Scale for the Evaluation of Creative Reading Process and the Critical Reading Scale. SPSS 23, AMOS 22.0, and structural equation modeling were utilized for data analysis. Maximum Likelihood method was selected in the estimation of parameters related to models which were formed for examining the effect of critical reading skills on the evaluation of creative reading process and the role of gender. To this end, fit indices (X[superscript 2]/df, CFI, GFI, TLI, NFI, IFI, RMSEA, and SRMR) were used. Findings: The study demonstrated that all hypotheses models were valid; critical reading skills explained the evaluation skills of creative reading process by 57%, and that they had a direct and strong impact on the evaluation skills of the critical reading process. In the female learner model, critical reading skills affected the evaluation skills by 43%, whereas the malelearner model explained this effect by 67%. In addition, both models bear a direct and strong impact. Implications for Research and Practice: The results of the study reveal that critical reading skill is a significant predictor for the evaluation of the creative reading process. It can be stated that the evaluation skills of the creative reading process may improve in conjunction with the development of critical reading skills.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1263407&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

This proposal is complemented by the objective of determining the influence of different learning styles on the preference for the type of performance in university teaching. A hypothetico-deductive methodological design for exploratory and correlational purposes was followed. The sample consisted of total of 640 participants in university degree courses. The data were gathered using a questionnaire that grouped 46 items into five double-response dimensions, determined by the preference or position held by the students regarding the learning strategies, methods and techniques applied; material or resources used to carry out the teaching, as well as the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT); type of supports that were received in the process; instruments to carry out the assessment; and lastly, individual or team academic performance. The outcomes show an x-ray of four models according to the student's learning styles: individual, cooperative, dependent and autonomous. These are identified with four clusters in the sample of students selected for the study, which are associated with practical, conventional, critical and efficient student models. The conclusions explain that there are no pure models, as there are nuances that connect them in real classroom practice, but the level of student preference helps to measure the impact and confirms the improvement in teaching through university work projects.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1262562&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

However, the complexity of the tasks may impede the progress of novice learners. Providing adaptive feedback to learners who face difficulties requires learner modeling approaches that can identify learners' proficiencies and the difficulties they face in executing required skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes. This paper discusses a multilevel hierarchical learner modeling scheme that analyzes and captures learners' cognitive processes and problem-solving strategies along with their performance on assigned tasks in a game-based environment called UrbanSim that requires complex decision making for dealing with counterinsurgency scenarios. As the scenario evolves in a turn-by-turn fashion, UrbanSim evaluates the learners' moves using a number of performance measures. Our learner modeling scheme interprets the reported performance values by analyzing the learners' activities captured in log files to derive learners' proficiencies in associated cognitive skills and strategies, and updates the learner model. We discuss the details of the learner modeling algorithms in this paper, and then demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting results from a study we conducted at Vanderbilt University.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1248030&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Given a learner's history of past interactions with an ITS, a learner performance model estimates the current state of a learner's knowledge and predicts her future performance. The advent of increasingly large scale datasets has turned deep learning models for learner performance prediction into competitive alternatives to classical Markov process and logistic regression models. In an extensive empirical comparison on nine real-world datasets, we ask which approach makes the most accurate predictions and in what conditions. Logistic regression--with the right set of features--leads on datasets of moderate size or containing or containing a very large number of interactions per student, whereas Deep Knowledge Tracing leads on datasets of large size or where precise temporal information matters most. Markov process methods, like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, lag behind other approaches. We follow this analysis with ablation studies to determine what components of leading algorithms explain their performance and a discussion of model calibration (reliability), which is crucial for downstream applications of learner performance prediction models.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1273917&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The approach defines which concepts from domain knowledge should be included in the initial test so the system can make conclusions about what students truly know about domain knowledge. This representative subset of domain knowledge is defined using non-semantic mathematical approach based on graph theory. The initial test, created over a domain knowledge representative subset, guarantees encompassing all concepts that are relevant to domain knowledge. A two-level case study is conducted on what would be the representative subset of one selected domain knowledge. It compares semantically selected domain knowledge representative subsets (semantical analysis was done by domain area experts) to a non-semantical, mathematically selected domain knowledge representative subset. The results of the case study show that problems of inequality of semantically selected domain knowledge representative subsets are easily overcome using the presented approach.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1247021&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

As such, it can enhance the learning process and improve student participation. Towards this direction, this paper investigates how mobile learning and game-based learning can be utilized in higher education settings and analyzes the pedagogical affordance of their adoption. As a testbed for our research, we designed and implemented Quiz Time! which is an intelligent mobile game-based learning application for assessing and advancing learners' knowledge in the programming language C#. Quiz Time! employs an assessing knowledge module for testing the knowledge of learners, a vectorial-based recommendation module for proposing personalized collaboration in group playing, a dynamic fuzzy logic-based advice generator for tailored assistance to learners' profile and misconceptions, and a cognitive learner modeler supporting the aforementioned modules. Quiz Time! was used in a higher education institution for an academic semester and was evaluated by students and computer science experts using an established framework and the statistical hypothesis test. Regarding the evaluation results, the computer science experts validated the pedagogical adequacy of the application and the students highlighted its positive impact on learning and its usefulness. A major conclusion is that incorporating personalization and collaboration in mobile game-based learning can further assist students in higher education towards advancing their knowledge level. • Edutainment advances students' knowledge level in higher education. • Mobile game-based learning promotes students' engagement in higher education. • Personalized recommendation for collaboration increases students' learning outcome. • Tailored advice upgrades students' knowledge and skills and decreases dropout rates. • Fuzzy logic promotes individualized learning environments supporting higher education.

To this end, computerized adaptive learning (CAL) systems are developed. A popular method to track the development of student ability and item difficulty, in CAL systems, is the Elo Rating System (ERS). The ERS allows for dynamic model parameters by updating key parameters after every response. However, drawbacks of the ERS are that it does not provide standard errors and that it results in rating variance inflation. We identify three statistical issues responsible for both of these drawbacks. To solve these issues we introduce a new tracking system based on urns, where every person and item is represented by an urn filled with a combination of green and red marbles. Urns are updated, by an exchange of marbles after each response, such that the proportions of green marbles represent estimates of person ability or item difficulty. A main advantage of this approach is that the standard errors are known, hence the method allows for statistical inference, such as testing for learning effects. We highlight features of the Urnings algorithm and compare it to the popular ERS in a simulation study and in an empirical data example from a large-scale CAL application.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=32138312&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Opening the model in an understandable form provides additional methods of prompting reflection, planning, and other metacognitive activities that are important in learning. Learner-system discussion, editing or other interaction about the learner model can allow users to contribute more directly to the modeling process to increase its accuracy, while at the same time, further facilitating reflection as they justify their viewpoints to themselves and the system. Social learning can be supported by opening learner models to peers, helping learners to gauge their relative progress, and effectively seek collaborators. OLMs can also provide useful information to others supporting the learning process, such as teachers and parents.

Findings: Empirical findings suggest that to motivate participation, organizational KM practices need to be geared towards promoting curiosity and engaging learners. Results indicate that overt recognition of knowledge seeking behaviors by HR could be counterproductive. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited to an MNC engineering organization in one geographic location; one must be cautious when generalizing these results. Replicating this study in multiple organizations will help mitigate this limitation. Originality/value: Little is known on the effect of KM and HR practices on knowledge seeking behaviors. This work addresses this gap and presents a comprehensive model.

While relatively easy to implement, little is known about whether students use the feedback provided by such models and whether they benefit from it. In this study, the use of inspectable student models in an introductory university statistics course by 599 first-year social science students was monitored. Research questions focused on whether students sought feedback from the student models, which decisions for subsequent study steps they made, and how this feedback seeking and decision making related to results on their statistics exams. Results showed a large variety among students in feedback-seeking and decision-making behavior. Lower student model scores seemed to encourage students to practice more on the same topic and higher scores seemed to evoke the decision to move to a different topic. Viewing frequency and amount of variety in decision making were positively related to exam results, even when controlling for total time students worked. These findings imply that inspectable student models can be a valuable addition to electronic learning environments and suggest that more intensive use of inspectable student models may contribute to learning. • Students' use of feedback by inspectable student models on statistics is monitored. • Feedback-viewing frequency and feedback-informed decisions vary widely among students. • Low scores in inspectable student models encourage students to practice more. • Frequent feedback-seeking is associated with higher exam grades.

Using the Bayesian network with strong self-learning ability to construct the intelligent teaching system student model can significantly improve the intelligence level of the intelligent teaching system. Firstly, we discussed the basic concepts of the student model of the intelligent teaching system. Then, from the perspective of students' ability teaching, combined with the students' learning status and characteristics, the factors influencing the students' learning process are analyzed. Finally, an intelligent teaching system student model was built based on Bayesian network. This model can objectively evaluate students' cognitive ability and can infer students' next action.

A limited number of studies evaluate the use of cadaver models as a potential ultrasound teaching and training modality. We hypothesize that emergency medicine residents can effectively utilize point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) on cadaver models and a focused teaching intervention to assess their ability to detect ATRs. Methods A prospective study of 23 EM residents was performed. All participants in the study were divided into two learner groups: (a) independent and (b) hands-on. The independent learner group received a 30-minute online didactic lecture demonstrating how to diagnose ATRs. The hands-on learner group received direct instruction on cadaver lower leg models with a ruptured and normal Achilles tendon (AT). Both groups then participated in identifying either normal or ruptured ATs on six cadaver lower leg models. Results The sensitivity and specificity were 89% and 82% in the independent learner group 96% and 100% in the hands-on learner group, respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 88%, respectively. There was a trend toward successful identification with increased years of residency training. Conclusions In this study, lower leg and ankle cadaver models were found to be as effective as an independent learner model for potential POCUS teaching and training modality in both novice and more advanced trainees.

A total of 61 articles on adaptive learning were analyzed to describe the current state of research and identify gaps in the literature. Descriptive characteristics were recorded, including publication patterns, instructional context, and research methodology components. The count of adaptive learning articles published fluctuated across the decade and peaked in 2015. During this time, the largest concentration of adaptive learning articles appeared in Computers and Education. The majority of the studies occurred in higher education in Taiwan and the United States, with the highest concentration in the computer science discipline. The research focus, adaptive strategies, and adaptive technologies used in these studies were also reviewed. The research was aligned with various instructional design phases, with more studies examining design and development, and implementation and evaluation. For examining adaptive strategies, the authors examined both adaptive sources based on learner model and adaptive targets based on content and instructional model. Learning style was the most observed learner characteristic, while adaptive feedback and adaptive navigation were the most investigated adaptive targets. This study has implications for adaptive learning designers and future researchers regarding the gaps in adaptive learning research. Future studies might focus on the increasing availability and capacities of adaptive learning as a learning technology to assist individual learning and personalized growth.

Despite the important roles that OLMs play in higher education to support the learning process and self-regulated learning (SRL) in particular, there are few studies systematically reviewing OLM technology in higher education, and investigating their potential to foster self-regulated learning. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of a 30-year sample of OLM studies in higher education and identified 64 articles that study the use of OLMs in supporting SRL. Our findings show that OLMs have been mainly used to support learners' cognition and a bit less metacognition and motivation; however, emotional support has been rarely provided. The most supported ones are Appraisal and Performance phases; Preparation of learning is enhanced by OLMs not so often. Although learners can edit or negotiate with their learning model in advanced ways, a simple inspectable OLM is more preferred. Reliance on unobservable nodes is less favored in modeling techniques in OLMs because such methods are highly dependent on expert authoring, thereby time-intensive and costly. Comparison and color-coding are two most-used features in OLMs, where the comparison feature is often used for enhancing learners' engagement and motivation. • Among area of SRL, OLMs support cognition and then metacognition and motivation. • OLMs mostly ignore emotion area of SRL. • Preparation phase of SRL is largely neglected by OLMs. • Simple inspectable OLMs are more preferred than advanced OLMs. • OLM's challenge: presentation, transparency, granularity, control level, and theorizing.

It is essential towards the development of intelligent machines that can adapt to their surroundings. In this work we focus on a lifelong learning approach to unsupervised generative modeling, where we continuously incorporate newly observed distributions into a learned model. We do so through a student-teacher Variational Autoencoder architecture which allows us to learn and preserve all the distributions seen so far, without the need to retain the past data nor the past models. Through the introduction of a novel cross-model regularizer, inspired by a Bayesian update rule, the student model leverages the information learned by the teacher, which acts as a probabilistic knowledge store. The regularizer reduces the effect of catastrophic interference that appears when we learn over sequences of distributions. We validate our model's performance on sequential variants of MNIST, FashionMNIST, PermutedMNIST, SVHN and Celeb-A and demonstrate that our model mitigates the effects of catastrophic interference faced by neural networks in sequential learning scenarios.

A key component for their personalization is the student model, which infers the knowledge level of the students to balance the difficulty of the exercises. While important advances have been achieved, several challenges remain. In particular, the models should be able to track in real-time the evolution of the students’ knowledge levels. These evolutions are likely to follow different profiles for each student, while measuring the exact knowledge level remains difficult given the limited and noisy information provided by the interactions. This paper introduces a novel model that addresses these challenges with three contributions: 1) the model relies on Gaussian Processes to track online the evolution of the student's knowledge level over time, 2) it uses collaborative filtering to rapidly provide long-term predictions by leveraging the information from previous users, and 3) it automatically generates abstract representations of knowledge components via automatic relevance determination of covariance matrices. The model is evaluated on three datasets, including real users. The results demonstrate that the model converges to accurate predictions in average four times faster than the compared methods.

However, knowledge tracing is difficult when learners have only had a few practice opportunities, which is often common in block-based programming. This article proposed two knowledge tracing models that can exploit the problem-solving process data generated by learners from a single programming task. A novel metric, the approaching index, was developed using the tree edit distance in abstract syntax trees to measure the similarities between the learners' intermediate solutions and the optimal solution. The proposed method allows for each learner's programming path to be represented as a raw approaching index sequence (AISeq) or as a single variable (AIScore) by averaging the AISeq. A logistic regression model was first designed to predict the learners' performances using their AIScore, the number of attempts, and their current performance. A second model, a recurrent neural network model, was also developed to directly use the AISeq and to make predictions. To verify the effectiveness of these models, a series of statistical analyses and experiments were conducted on two existing large-scale block-based programming datasets, the results from which revealed that the proposed models were competitive with four state-of-the-art models on multiple metrics, such as the precision-recall curve, accuracy, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa. Especially, the proposed models were found to be more robust than the compared models in predicting who would fail to complete the tasks.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1282884&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Artificial intelligence has begun to be used in medical education, which consists of enormously complex information and which continues throughout life. Cognitive psychology revealed that knowledge is best remembered when it is taught in a way that it can be used, practiced and evaluated. In this context, artificial intelligence applications can be useful in clinical reasoning, as well as assessment and evaluation in medical education. In addition, ""smart educational systems"" that enable students to receive personalized education as a result of measuring their learning levels are also promising. Here, in the light of current national and international publications, the latest developments in the field of medicine and pathology are presented. Articles in English in international large medical databases, Pubmed and Medline Complete, and national Turkish publications in ULAKBİM and DergiPark databases published between January 2000 and July 2020 are searched for analysis. The keywords ""undergraduate medical education and artificial intelligence"", ""undergraduate pathology education and artificial intelligence"", ""machine learning and undergraduate medical education"" and ""machine learning and undergraduate pathology education"" during international search, and ""yapay zeka ve tıp eğitimi"", ""makine öğrenmesi ve tıp eğitimi"", ""yapay zeka ve patoloji eğitimi ve ""makine öğrenmesi ve patoloji eğitimi"" during national search are used. Though publications on the use of artificial intelligence in medical education in international databases have been increasing in recent years, they are still very scarce. As a result of the literature review, 37 publications are found, 32 of which are about the use of artificial intelligence in the field of learning in medical education, 4 on the use of assessment and evaluation, and 1 on curriculum analysis and development. Examples of artificial intelligence applications in medical education so far include virtual patient simulator projects such as ATTENDING, GUIDON, TeachMed and TOUCH, etc., virtual reality surgery simulation applications, robot simulated patient applications, chatbot /teacherbot applications and wearable sensors. Although there are no publications on the use of artificial intelligence in pathology education, we think that it can be used in student learning and evaluation. Thus, projects can be developed in the fields of macroscopy / autopsy training, creating chatbots and creating case-based digital microscopy platforms. Technical problems (difficulty in developing models, difficulty in creating content, inadequate doctor-engineer cooperation, etc.) and doubts about whether it will work (difficulties in evaluating its effectiveness, having a narrow application range, etc.) are some of the obstacles related to the development of artificial intelligence applications in medical education. In order for these applications to be successful, it is necessary to take into account the issues such as current educational theories and pedagogical information, student modeling and institutional planning. The most effective results can be achieved through teamwork in which medicine, education, computer experts and students are together during design. It is clear that artificial intelligence will be used more frequently in the fields of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment in medicine in the near future. Training of medical students with a curriculum where they can see and comprehend artificial intelligence applications and experience them in their own education will enable them to be more prepared and equipped for the future.

It can make full use of the advantages of the network across regions, and make full use of the advantages of network technology to share the resources of colleges and universities, which is a promising educational method. In response to the demand of online education for learner information, this paper proposes the learner model Neighbor Mean Variation Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (NMVMOPSO-GA). This model includes the learner’s learning interest sub-model, the learner’s cognitive ability sub-model and the learner’s knowledge sub-model. The modelling techniques of the three sub-models are discussed separately, and their status and role in the online education system are analyzed. At the same time, for the knowledge model that reflects the learner’s learning progress and knowledge mastery, a learner knowledge sub-model constructed with Bayesian networks is proposed. The neighbor mean mutation operator is introduced to optimize the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and improve the convergence performance and stability of the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. We study the application of multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm in online course resource generation service. Through simulation experiments, it is verified that the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm can improve the performance and stability of online course resource generation.

Although students believe that highlighting and subsequent review of the highlights will further their educational goals, the psychological literature provides little evidence of benefits. Nonetheless, a student's choice of text for highlighting may serve as a window into her mental state-her level of comprehension, grasp of the key ideas, reading goals, and so on. We explore this hypothesis via an experiment in which 400 participants read three sections from a college-level biology text, briefly reviewed the text, and then took a quiz on the material. During initial reading, participants were able to highlight words, phrases, and sentences, and these highlights were displayed along with the complete text during the subsequent review. Consistent with past research, the amount of highlighted material is unrelated to quiz performance. Nonetheless, highlighting patterns may allow us to infer reader comprehension and interests. Using multiple representations of the highlighting patterns, we built probabilistic models to predict quiz performance and matrix factorization models to predict what content would be highlighted in one passage from highlights in other passages. We find that quiz score prediction accuracy reliably improves with the inclusion of highlighting data (by about 1%-2%), both for held-out students and for held-out student questions (i.e., questions selected randomly for each student), but not for held-out questions. Furthermore, an individual's highlighting pattern is informative of what she highlights elsewhere. Our long-term goal is to design digital textbooks that serve not only as conduits of information into the reader's mind but also allow us to draw inferences about the reader at a point where interventions may increase the effectiveness of the material. © 2020 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=33191526&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Current student knowledge models can alleviate some of the problems in learning (i.e. predicting student performance) but they neglect learning diagnostics, which is based on causal reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel heterogeneous attention interpreter with a maximum entropy regularizer on top of a student knowledge model to achieve explainable learning diagnostics. Our model segregates the impact of the homogeneous knowledge points, while promoting the heterogeneous relatives by maximizing their chance to contribute to the prediction. We also propose a multi-spatial knowledge representation that is readily generalizable to other data-driven educational tasks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets reveal that the proposed method is able to enhance the model's explanatory power, hence increases the trustworthiness towards learning diagnostics. It also brings notable improvement in accuracy in the student performance prediction task. The findings in this paper are adoptable to various types of e-learning systems to assist teachers to gain insights into student learning states and diagnose learning problems. • Autonomously diagnosing learning problems in e-learning systems can be challenging due to the lack of teacher resources (teachers) in e-learning.

A crucial factor for successful educational results in computer-based educational systems and e-learning systems is the learner's assessment. Assessment is more effective when it is tailored to each individual student's learning needs and abilities. Therefore, a significant research challenge is to create tests that include exercises/questions/activities etc., which conform to each learner's knowledge level and learning needs and abilities. This goal constitutes the need for creating adaptive tests. However, the area of adaptive e-assessment has not yet been explored sufficiently and thus there is scope for a lot of improvement. To this end, in this paper we present a novel solution for adaptive e-assessment. The novelty and significance lie in the blending of fuzzy logic and cognitive theories for further enhancing the personalization and adaptivity in e-assessment. Particularly, fuzzy sets are used to describe the knowledge level of students in a more realistic way. Furthermore, the cognitive theory of Revised Bloom Taxonomy is used to express the learning objectives that are required to be assessed through the created test. In addition, a fuzzy rule-based reasoner, which decides about the number and the difficulty level of the test items that have to be included into the created personalized test for each level of the Revised Bloom Taxonomy, is used. The fuzzy rules are applied to the fuzzy sets that describe the learners' knowledge level. For the formation of the fuzzy sets and rules, the opinion of several tutors, holding experience in the educational process and instruction, was taken into consideration. The created adaptive test comprises distinct test items based on the individual learning needs of each student. The presented method has been used in two tutoring systems and has been fully evaluated. The evaluation results show great accuracy in the selection of test items for each individual student.

The proposed flexible model for organizing blended and distance learning in higher education involves the creation of an individual learning path through testing students before the start of training.

The training path consists of mandatory and additional modules for training; additional modules can be skipped after successfully passing the test, without studying these modules. The paper examines the composition of intelligent learning systems: student model, learning model and interface model. A student model is described, which contains the level of their knowledge, skills and abilities, the ability to learn, the ability to complete tasks (whether they know how to use the information received or not), personal characteristics (type, orientation) and other factors. The student's model is described by a mathematical formula.

Within 901 LA articles analyzed, eight reviews were identified and synthesised to identify and determine consistencies and gaps. Results show that LA is at the stage of early majority and has attracted great research efforts from other fields. The majority of LA publications were focused on proposing LA concepts or frameworks and conducting proof-of-concept analysis rather than conducting actual data analysis. Collecting small datasets for LA research is predominant, especially in K-12 field. Finally, four major LA research topics, including prediction of performance, decision support for teachers and learners, detection of behavioural patterns & learner modelling and dropout prediction, were identified and discussed deeply. The future research of LA is also outlined for purpose of better understanding and optimising learning as well as learning contexts.

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, existing approaches can only exploit the exercising records of students, and the problem of extracting rich information existed in the materials (e.g., knowledge concepts, exercise content) of exercises to achieve both more precise prediction of student performance and more interpretable analysis of knowledge acquisition remains underexplored. To this end, in this paper, we present a holistic study of student performance prediction. To directly achieve the primary goal of performance prediction, we first propose a general Exercise-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (EERNN) framework by exploring both student's exercising records and the text content of corresponding exercises. In EERNN, we simply summarize each student's state into an integrated vector and trace it with a recurrent neural network, where we design a bidirectional LSTM to learn the encoding of each exercise from its content. For making final predictions, we design two implementations on the basis of EERNN with different prediction strategies, i.e., EERNNM with Markov property and EERNNA with Attention mechanism. Then, to explicitly track student's knowledge acquisition on multiple knowledge concepts, we extend EERNN to an explainable Exercise-aware Knowledge Tracing (EKT) framework by incorporating the knowledge concept information, where the student's integrated state vector is now extended to a knowledge state matrix. In EKT, we further develop a memory network for quantifying how much each exercise can affect the mastery of students on multiple knowledge concepts during the exercising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate both EERNN and EKT frameworks on a large-scale real-world data. The results in both general and cold-start scenarios clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of two frameworks in student performance prediction as well as the superior interpretability of EKT.

Therefore, this work introduces a new student model based on BKT. It takes the relationship between knowledge into account. By doing this, the new model proves higher prediction accuracy and performs better. Then this paper uses the new model to make a cognitive diagnosis according to students' test scores.

The purpose of this study is to examine students' views about the OSLM in an e-learning system. Design/methodology/approach: This case study was conducted with 40 undergraduate students enrolled in advanced programming and database management system courses. A Likert-type questionnaire and open-ended questions were used to obtain the students' views. System usage data were also analyzed to ensure the richness and diversity of the overall data set. Findings: The quantitative data of the students' views were analyzed with descriptive statistics; the results are presented as graphics. The qualitative data of the students' views were examined by content analysis to derive themes. These themes are organized into four subtopics: the students' positive views, their negative views, their improvement suggestions and their preferences about using similar OSLM visualizations in other e-learning systems. The students' subjective views are discussed in the context of their recorded interactions with the system. Research limitations/implications: Competition due to seeing peer models was considered by participants both as positive and negative features of the learning system. So, this study revealed that, the ways to combine peer learner models to e-learning systems that promote positive competition without resulting social pressure, still need to be explored. Practical implications: By combining open learner models with open peer models, OSLM enhances the learning process in three different ways: it supports self-regulation, encourages competition and empowers self-evaluation. To take advantage of these positive contributions, practitioners should consider enhancing e-learning systems with both own learner and peer model features. Originality/value: Despite increasing interest in OSLM studies, several limitations and problems must be addressed such as sparsity of data and lack of study of different contexts and cultures. To date, no published study in this area exists in Turkey. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap by examining OSLM features in an e-learning system from the perspectives of Turkish students by using both their system interaction data and their subjective views.

In this paper, we compare two AutoML feature engineering methods in the context of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data mining competition. The methods we compare, Featuretools and TSFRESH (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests), have rarely been applied in the context of student interaction log data. Thus, we address research questions regarding the accuracy of models built with AutoML features, how AutoML feature types compare to each other and to expert-engineered features, and how interpretable the features are. Additionally, we developed a novel feature selection method that addresses problems applying AutoML feature engineering in this context, where there were many heterogeneous features (over 4,000) and relatively few students. Our entry to the NAEP competition placed 3rd overall on the final held-out dataset and 1st on the public leaderboard, with a final Cohen's kappa = 0.212 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.665 when predicting whether students would manage their time effectively on a math assessment. We found that TSFRESH features were significantly more effective than either Featuretools features or expert-engineered features in this context; however, they were also among the most difficult features to interpret based on a survey of six experts' judgments. Finally, we discuss the tradeoffs between effort and interpretability that arise in AutoML-based student modeling.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1320544&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

By personalizing the temporal distribution of retrieval practice of a given piece of knowledge, they improve learners' long-term memory retention compared to fixed review schedules. However, such algorithms are generally designed for the pure memorization of single items, such as vocabulary words. Yet, the spacing effect has been shown to extend to more complex knowledge, such as the practice of mathematical skills. In this article, we extend three adaptive spacing heuristics from the literature for selecting the best skill to review at any timestamp given a student's past study history. In real-world educational settings, items generally involve multiple skills at the same time. Thus, we also propose a multi-skill version for two of these heuristics: instead of selecting one single skill, they select with a greedy procedure the most promising subset of skills to review. To compare these five heuristics, we develop a synthetic experimental framework that simulates student learning and forgetting trajectories with a student model. We run multiple synthetic experiments on large cohorts of 500 simulated students and publicly release the code for these experiments. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each heuristic in terms of performance, robustness, and complexity. Finally, we find evidence that selecting the best subset of skills yields better retention compared to selecting the single best skill to review.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1320640&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Thus, the game flow can be optimized to increase efficiency and effectiveness of gaming and learning in parallel. In the field of gaming still the Bartle model is commonly used due to its simplicity and good mapping to game scenarios, for learning the Learning Style Inventory from Kolb or Index of Learning Styles by Felder and Silverman are well known. For personality traits the NEO‐FFI (Big5) model is widely accepted. When designing games it is always a challenge to assess one player’s profile characteristics properly in all three models (player/learner/personality). Still, it is valuable to collect information to refine the models continuously to adapt the game experience precisely to a player’s models. To reduce the effort and amount of dimensions and questionnaires a player might have to fill out, we proved the hypothesis that both, Learning Style Inventory and Bartle Player Types could be predicted by knowing the personality traits based on NEO‐FFI. Thus we investigated the statistical correlations among the models by collecting answers to the questionnaires of Bartle Test, Kolb LSI 3.1 and BFI‐K (short version of NEO‐FFI). The study was conducted in spring 2012 with six school classes of grade 9 (12‐14year old students) in two different secondary schools in Germany. 72 students participated in the study which was offered optionally after the use of a game‐based learning tool for peer learning. We present the results, statistics and correlations among the models as well as the interdependencies with the student’s level of proficiency and their social connectedness. In conclusion, the evaluation proved the independency of the models and the validity of the dimensions. Still, especially for all of the playing style preferences of Bartle’s model significant correlations with some of the analyzed other questionnaire items could be found. As no predictions of learning style preferences is possible on the basis of this studies data, the final recommendation for the development of game‐ based learning application concludes that separate modeling for the adaptation game flow (playing) and learn flow (learning) is still necessary.

It consists of a graphical presentation of the learners' competency profile (following the open learner model's approach) and a personalized resources recommendation system. To assess its usefulness and usability, we conducted a study to test the COMPER service on 181 first-year students (from a two-year university diploma in computing), in addition to practical work carried out remotely. Based on a survey (usage data and scales) analysis, our study shows that globally the learners perceive the service as useful, especially those who favor working individually. Finally, our findings showed how much attention must be paid before implementing an independent OLM into an existing learning environment, especially for learners lacking SRL competencies.

AMT environment is structured in accordance with the rapid prototyping software developing model. In this environment, there are questions for the students about four learning objectives, which are among the basic subjects of the Statistics course. AMT environment consists of presentation, assessment, domain and learner model. Pilot implementation was carried out with 98 undergraduate students. In order to evaluate of the environment; number of tests taken, number of correct answer, number of wrong answer and number of total answer data were used. According to the findings, it is seen that most of the students are masters in the learning objectives presented to them. In addition, it was found that half of the students took an average test to become a master. In other words, half of the learners participating in the study were determined as masters by the system in the first test they took for each learning objective.

Student coursework can potentially be structured as a graph. Incorporating this graph-structured nature into a knowledge tracing model as a relational inductive bias can improve its performance; however, previous methods, such as deep knowledge tracing, did not consider such a latent graph structure. Inspired by the recent successes of graph neural networks (GNNs), we herein propose a GNN-based knowledge tracing method, i.e., graph-based knowledge tracing. Casting the knowledge structure as a graph enabled us to reformulate the knowledge tracing task as a time-series node-level classification problem in the GNN. As the knowledge graph structure is not explicitly provided in most cases, we propose various implementations of the graph structure. Empirical validations on two open datasets indicated that our method could potentially improve the prediction of student performance and demonstrated more interpretable predictions compared to those of the previous methods, without the requirement of any additional information.

This is achieved by the technology of student modeling. One prevalent technique of student modeling is stereotypes. Furthermore, individuals differ in how they learn. So, the way that helps an individual to learn best is crucial for offering her/him an effective tutoring experience. As a consequence, students' preferable styles of learning should be incorporated into the student model. However, some researchers have concluded that there are individuals that have a mixture of learning styles. That is the reason for the combination of two different learning style models in the presented approach. Particularly, in this paper we present a stereotype student model that combines the Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing and Kinesthetic (VARK) learning style model and the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI). The aim of this article is to further enhance the personalization to students' needs and preferences by introducing this hybrid instrument and using the technology of stereotypes. The gain from this hybrid learning style approach is that we model two different dimensions of the way that a student prefers to learn: i) the sensory modalities of learning and ii) the way of thinking. In this way, the offered tutoring process can be more tailored to each individual student's needs, respecting the distinct pace of her/his learning. Our novel approach has been incorporated in an e-learning system and was evaluated by 60 undergraduate students in Greece. The evaluation results show a great acceptance rate of the novel hybrid learning style model by students and underline its pedagogical potential.

Predictive student models use trace data extracted from students' in-game learning behaviors to unobtrusively generate early assessments of student knowledge and skills, equipping game-based learning environments with the capacity to anticipate student outcomes and proactively deliver adaptive scaffolding or notify instructors. Reflection is a key component of self-regulated learning, and it is critical in effective learning. However, there is currently limited work exploring the utility of reflection for inducing accurate predictive student models. This article presents a predictive student modeling framework that leverages natural language responses to in-game reflection prompts to predict student learning outcomes in a game-based learning environment for middle school microbiology, CRYSTAL ISLAND. With data from a pair of classroom studies involving 118 middle school students, we investigate the accuracy of early prediction models that utilize features extracted from student trace data combined with word embedding-based representations (i.e., GloVe, ELMo) of student reflection responses. We evaluate the accuracy of the predictive models over time using data from incremental segments of each student's interaction with the game-based learning environment, and we compare against models that omit student reflection features. Results reveal that models encoding students' natural language reflections with ELMo word embeddings yield significantly improved accuracy compared to other representations, with the greatest accuracy demonstrated by an ensemble of predictive models. We discuss the implications of these results for the design of game-based learning environments.

Therefore, emotion recognition is becoming very relevant in educational scenarios, but there is no standard method for predicting students' affects. However, physiological signals have been widely used in educational contexts. Some physiological signals have shown a high accuracy in detecting emotions because they reflect spontaneous affect-related information, which is fresh and does not require additional control or interpretation. Most proposed works use measuring equipment for which applicability in real-world scenarios is limited because of its high cost and intrusiveness. To tackle this problem, in this work, we analyse the feasibility of developing low-cost and nonintrusive devices to obtain a high detection accuracy from easy-to-capture signals. By using both inter-subject and intra-subject models, we present an experimental study that aims to explore the potential application of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to predict the concentration state from 4 commonly used physiological signals, namely heart rate, breath rate, skin conductance and skin temperature. We also study the effect of combining these four signals and analyse their potential use in an educational context in terms of intrusiveness, cost and accuracy. The results show that a high accuracy can be achieved with three of the signals when using HMM-based intra-subject models. However, inter-subject models, which are meant to obtain subject-independent approaches for affect detection, fail at the same task.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=33806438&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The purpose of this current study is to assess the preventive, supportive and awareness-building steps taken during the COVID-19 pandemic for international students in China, that will be useful for planning such a behavioral change campaign in the potential pandemic situation in other parts of the world. Methods: We conducted an online-based e-questionnaire survey among 467 international students in China through WeChat. The data collection duration was from February 20, 2020 to March 10, 2020 and we focused on their level of awareness, satisfaction, and trust in authorities regarding pandemic measures. Simple bivariate statistics was used to describe the background characteristics of the respondents along with adoption of the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) as the final model to demonstrate the relationship between the variables. Results: In our study, the leading group of the respondents were within 31 to 35 years' age group (39.82%), male (61.88%), living single (58.24%) and doctoral level students (39.8%). The preventive and supportive measures taken by students and/or provided by the respective institution or authorities were positively related to students' satisfaction and had an acceptable strength (β = 0.611, t = 9.679, p < 0.001). The trust gained in authorities also showed an acceptable strength (β = 0.381, t = 5.653, p < 0.001) with a positive direction. Again, the personnel awareness building related to both students' satisfaction (β = 0.295, t = 2.719, p < 0.001) and trust gain (β = 0.131, t = 1.986, p < 0.05) in authorities had a positive and acceptable intensity. Therefore, our study clearly demonstrates the great impact of preventive and supportive measures in the development of students' satisfaction (R 2 = 0.507 indicating moderate relationship). The satisfied students possessed a strong influence which eventually helped in building sufficient trust on their institutions (R 2 = 0.797 indicating above substantial relationship). Conclusions: The worldwide student group is one of the most affected and vulnerable communities in this situation. So, there is a profound ground of research on how different states or authorities handle such situation. In this study, we have depicted the types and magnitude of care taken by Chinese government and educational institutions towards international students to relieve the panic of pandemic situation. Further research and such initiatives should be taken in to consideration for future emerging conditions.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=33712081&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Virtual patient simulators (VPSs) may partially meet these needs. Natural language processing (NLP) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) may further enhance the educational impact of these simulators. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a VPS for clinical diagnostic reasoning that integrates interaction in natural language and an ITS. We also aimed to provide preliminary results of a short-term learning test administered on undergraduate students after use of the simulator. Methods: We trained a Siamese long short-term memory network for anamnesis and NLP algorithms combined with Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology for diagnostic hypothesis generation. The ITS was structured on the concepts of knowledge, assessment, and learner models. To assess short-term learning changes, 15 undergraduate medical students underwent two identical tests, composed of multiple-choice questions, before and after performing a simulation by the virtual simulator. The test was made up of 22 questions; 11 of these were core questions that were specifically designed to evaluate clinical knowledge related to the simulated case. Results: We developed a VPS called Hepius that allows students to gather clinical information from the patient's medical history, physical exam, and investigations and allows them to formulate a differential diagnosis by using natural language. Hepius is also an ITS that provides real-time step-by-step feedback to the student and suggests specific topics the student has to review to fill in potential knowledge gaps. Results from the short-term learning test showed an increase in both mean test score (P<.001) and mean score for core questions (P<.001) when comparing presimulation and postsimulation performance. Conclusions: By combining ITS and NLP technologies, Hepius may provide medical undergraduate students with a learning tool for training them in diagnostic reasoning. This may be particularly useful in a setting where students have restricted access to clinical wards, as is happening during the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries worldwide. ©Raffaello Furlan, Mauro Gatti, Roberto Menè, Dana Shiffer, Chiara Marchiori, Alessandro Giaj Levra, Vincenzo Saturnino, Enrico Brunetta, Franca Dipaola.

Empirical studies have verified that the learner models produced by SCNs can usually achieve favorable test performance in practice but more in-depth theoretical analysis of their generalization power would be useful for constructing SCN-based ensemble models with enhanced generalization capacities. In particular, given a collection of independently developed SCN-based learner models, it is useful to select certain base learners that can potentially obtain preferable test results rather than considering all of the base models together, before simply taking their average in order to build an effective ensemble model. In this study, we propose a novel framework for building SCN ensembles by exploring key factors that might potentially affect the generalization performance of the base model. Under a mild assumption, we provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for examining a learner model's generalization error, as well as formulating a novel indicator that contains measurement information for the training errors, output weights, and a hidden layer output matrix, which can be used by our proposed algorithm to find a subset of appropriate base models from a pool of randomized learner models. A toy example of one-dimensional function approximation, a case study for developing a predictive model for forecasting student learning performance, and two large-scale data sets were used in our experiments. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method has some remarkable advantages for building ensemble models.

Despite the frequent argument that LADs are useful to support target users and their goals to monitor and act upon the information provided, little is known about LADs' theoretical underpinnings and the alignment (or lack thereof) between LADs intended outcomes and the measures used to evaluate their implementation. However, this knowledge is necessary to illuminate more efficient approaches in the development and implementation of LAD tools. Guided by the self‐regulated learning perspective and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) framework, this systematic literature review addressed this gap by examining whether and how learner‐facing LAD's target outcomes align with the domain measures used to evaluate their implementations. Out of the 1297 papers retrieved from 15 databases, 28 were included in the final quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results suggested an intriguing lack of alignment between LADs' intended outcomes (mostly cognitive domain) and their evaluation (mostly affective measures). Based on these results and on the premise that LADs are designed to support learners, a critical recommendation from this study is that LADs' target outcomes should guide the selection of measures used to evaluate the efficacy of these tools. This alignment is critical to enable the construction of more robust guidelines to inform future endeavours in the field. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic There has been an increased interest and investment in learning analytics dashboards to support learners as end‐users.Learner‐facing learning analytics dashboards are designed with different purposes, functionalities and types of data in an attempt to influence learners' behaviour, achievement and skills.What this paper adds This paper reports trends and opportunities regarding the design of learner‐facing learning analytics dashboards, contexts of implementation, as well as types and features of learner‐facing learning analytics dashboard studies.The paper discusses how affect and motivation have been largely overlooked as target outcomes in learner‐facing learning analytics dashboards.Implications for practice and/or policy Based on the evidence gathered through the review, this paper makes recommendations for theory (eg, inclusion of motivation as an important target outcome).The paper makes recommendations related to the design, implementation and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards.The paper also highlights the need for further integration between learner‐facing learning analytics dashboards and open learner models.

We proposed a weighted-based model to estimate and suggest learning materials for students who are pursuing a computer-based course. We have built a brand new ITS called WinITS with our proposed responsive student model and deployed it in Hanoi National University of Education-Vietnam (HNUE) in the second semester of the school year 2019-2020 with a computer science course. To compare the effectiveness of applying ITS to the students, we compare test results and analyze some other aspects related to the course. On the other hand, we conducted a survey between two groups: with and without using WinITS. 63 students are volunteers who participated in the case study. Before learning, 43 students from Group 1 will take a short survey of the Felder-Silverman questionnaire to identify learning styles, after that, they go through all the lessons from the course under the support of WinITS, the lessons will be chosen to satisfy student's need. On another side, 18 students from Group 2 will make the same test to compare the result to Group 1. In the range of research, we illustrate that our implementation shows some encouraging results such as reducing learning time, improving test score by 1.13 standard deviations, and making the lesson more interesting and flexible. The results have revealed some advantages of studying with computer-added compared to the traditional class in various ways and showed the effectiveness of the proposed model in Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

Although learning is individual, a model can be created based on patterns in student behavior. Since a student model can be created for more than one student, the use of machine learning techniques in student modeling is increasing. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which form one group of machine learning techniques, are among the methods most frequently used in learning environments. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are specific types of these networks, are used effectively for complex problems such as image processing, computer vision and speech recognition. In this study, a student model was created using a CNN due to the complexity of the learning process, and the performance of the model was examined. The student modeling technique used was named LearnerPrints. The navigation data of the students in a learning management system were used to construct the model. Training and test data were used to analyze the performance of the model. The classification results showed that CNNs can be used effectively for student modeling. The modeling was based on the students' achievement and used the students' data from the learning management system. The study found that the LearnerPrints technique classified students with an accuracy of over 80%.

In recent years, various models were proposed to get accurate and easy-to-interpret results. To make sense of the wide Knowledge tracing (KT) modeling landscape, this paper conducts a systematic review to provide a detailed and nuanced discussion of relevant KT techniques from the perspective of assumptions, data, and algorithms. The results show that most existing KT models consider only a fragment of the assumptions that relate to the knowledge components within items and student's cognitive process. Almost all types of KT models take ""quize data"" as input, although it is insufficient to reflect a clear picture of students' learning process. Dynamic Bayesian network, logistic regression and deep learning are the main algorithms used by various knowledge tracing models. Some open issues are identified based on the analytics of the reviewed works and discussed potential future research directions.

Inspired by Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), the framework uses an eLearning ontology to express domain and learner models and to create a course. We combine the ontology with a procedural reasoning approach and precompiled plans to operationalize a design across disease conditions. The resulting courses generated by the framework are personalized across four patient axes-condition and treatment, comprehension level, learning style based on the VARK (Visual, Aural, Read/write, Kinesthetic) presentation model, and the level of understanding of specific course content according to Bloom's taxonomy. Customizing educational materials along these learning axes stimulates and sustains patients' attention when learning about their conditions or treatment options. Our proposed framework creates a personalized course that prepares patients for their meetings with specialists and educates them about their prescribed treatment. We posit that the improvement in patients' understanding of prescribed care will result in better outcomes and we validate that the constructs of our framework are appropriate for representing content and deriving personalized courses for two use cases: anticoagulation treatment of an atrial fibrillation patient and lower back pain management to treat a lumbar degenerative disc condition. We conduct a mostly qualitative study supported by a quantitative questionnaire to investigate the acceptability of the framework among the target patient population and medical practitioners.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=34299806&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

We formulate appropriate loss functions, driving a ""student"" model to adapt such that its local features exhibit similar geometrical characteristics to those of an ""instructor"" model, at corresponding layers. The investigated functions, inspired by manifold-to-manifold distance measures, are designed to compare the neighboring information inside the feature space of the involved activations without any restrictions in the features' dimensionality, thus enabling knowledge transfer between different architectures. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the proposed technique is effective in different settings, including knowledge-transfer to smaller models, transfer between different deep architectures and harnessing knowledge from external data, producing models with increased accuracy compared to a typical training. Furthermore, results indicate that the presented method can work synergistically with methods such as knowledge distillation, further increasing the accuracy of the trained models. Finally, experiments on training with limited data show that a combined regularization scheme can achieve the same generalization as a non-regularized training with 50% of the data in the CIFAR-10 classification task.

Learning styles and cognitive traits have been the subjects of research in this area. Although learning institutions use Learning Management Systems such as Moodle, Claroline, and Blackboard to facilitate teaching, the platforms do not have features for analyzing data and identifying behavior such as learning styles and cognitive traits. Instead, they only produce certain statistical reports from the daily access records. Even though complex models have been proposed in the literature, most studies are based on a single behavior such as learning styles or cognitive traits but not both. Only a few have investigated a combination of cognition-based theories such as working memory capacity and psychology-based ones such as learning styles. Thus, this study sought to answer the research question of whether it was possible to establish a methodology for the estimation of learning styles and cognitive traits from a learning management system. The study combined the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model and Cognitive Trait Model as theoretical frameworks to identify behavior in a Learning Management System. This study designed a model for extracting records from Learning Management Systems access records to estimate learning style and cognitive traits. From this, a prototype was developed to estimate the learning style and cognitive traits for each student. The model was evaluated by administering manual tools to students in a classroom environment then comparing the results gathered against those estimated by the model. The results analyzed using Kappa statistics demonstrated the interrater reliability results were moderately in agreement. Taken together, these results suggest that it is possible to estimate the learning styles and cognitive traits of a learner in a Learning Management System. The information generated by the model can be used by tutors to provide a conducive online learning environment where learners with similar behavior ask each other for help. This can reduce the teaching load for online tutors because learners themselves act as a teaching resource. Information on learning styles and cognitive styles can also facilitate online group formation by isolating the individual factors that contribute to team success.

Student modelling plays a prominent role in many intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that address problem-solving domains. However, considerably less attention has been paid to using a student model to personalize instruction in tutorial dialogue systems (TDSs)—ITSs that engage students in natural-language, conceptual discussions. This paper describes Rimac, a TDS that tightly couples student modelling with tutorial dialogues about conceptual physics. Rimac is distinct from other TDSs insofar as it dynamically builds a persistent student model that guides reactive and proactive decision making in order to provide adaptive instruction. An initial pilot study set in high school physics classrooms compared a control version of Rimac without a student model with an experimental version that implemented a ""poor man's student model""; that is, the model was initialized using students' pretest scores but not updated further. Both low and high prior knowledge students showed significant pretest to posttest learning gains. However, high prior knowledge students who used the experimental version of Rimac learned more efficiently than high prior knowledge students who used the control version. Specifically, high prior knowledge students who used the student model driven tutor took less time to complete the intervention but learned a similar amount as students who used the control version. A subsequent study found that both high and low prior knowledge students learned more efficiently from a version of the tutor that dynamically updates its student model during dialogues than from a control version that included the static ""poor man's student model."" We discuss future work needed to improve the performance of Rimac's student model and to integrate TDSs in the classroom.

In this paper, I describe the manner in which Jim influenced my own journey in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Education. In particular, he has influenced two directions in my research, one direction is the manner in which technology can influence teaching and learning for individuals working solo. The second direction is how technology can influence teaching and learning through collaboration. In both situations I will discuss Jim Greer's influence on my research with respect to learner modelling, educational data mining, and visualization. In the context of solo learning, I will discuss BioWorld, a system that fosters clinical reasoning in medical students, emphasizing the role of student modeling and educational data mining for fostering and identifying performance differences in clinical reasoning.

We proposed a systematic and comprehensive machine learning-based modeling methodology to develop high-performance predictive student models from the historical educational data to address this issue. This methodology addresses the fundamental modeling issues, from data processing, to modeling, to model deployment.

Final year osteopathy students were assessed using a hybrid ten station OSCE, comprising both online and face-to-face components. The examination was led by a pre-recorded narrated PowerPoint video. The video contained instructions, case information for five cases and prompts for the practical stations. A student model stepped into the room as needed for practical stations.

The hybrid OSCE was conducted safely during Stage 4 restrictions adhering to COVID Safe guidelines, allowing robust competency assessment of final year students, enabling timely graduation and transition to practice. Institutional support, technology infrastructure, clear communication and stakeholder collaboration are key to successful implementation.

KT is often implemented by intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) to predict the student performance, and schedule the individual learning plan for each student. However, most existing KT models cannot predict the knowledge forgetting well due to the lack of temporal information and some KT models for knowledge forgetting prediction are not accurate enough. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a recurrent knowledge tracing machine (RKTM), which temporally enriches the encoding of knowledge tracing machine (KTM) and difficulty, student ability, skill, and student skill practice history (DAS3H) with the knowledge state of students. RKTM consists of two major components, including the tracing component and the predicting component. The tracing component temporally traces the knowledge state of a student, while the predicting component captures the interaction between the current learning scenario and the current knowledge state of that student and provides accurate prediction of student performance. Experiments show that the proposed RKTM well outperforms KTM, DAS3H, and some other models.

These adaptive textbooks are most frequently powered by internal knowledge models, which associate a list of unique domain knowledge concepts with each section of the textbook. With this kind of concept-level knowledge representation, a number of intelligent operations could be performed, which include student modeling, adaptive navigation support, and content recommendation. However, manual indexing of each textbook section with concepts is challenging, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Modern research in the area of natural language processing offers an attractive alternative, called ""automatic keyphrase extraction."" While a range of keyphrase and concept extraction methods have been developed over the last twenty years, few of the known approaches were applied and evaluated in a textbook context. In this paper, we present FACE, a supervised feature-based machine learning method for automatic concept extractions from digital textbooks. This method has been created for building domain and student models that form the core of intelligent textbooks. We evaluated FACE on a newly constructed full-scale dataset by assessing how well it approximates concept annotations produced by human experts and how well it supports the needs of student modeling. The results show that FACE outperforms several state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction methods.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1316061&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Improving written literacy of newcomers can enhance education, employment, or social integration opportunities. However, frequent, timely, and personalized feedback is not always possible for immigrants. Online writing support tools can scaffold writing development by providing this feedback, but existing systems provide inadequate support when instructors are inaccessible. In this paper, we show how feedback system design can leverage peer and automated feedback to support mature English Language Learners' (ELL) needs and practices. We identify strong associations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies, highlighting the importance of tasks that activate productive epistemic beliefs. We find learners accurately assessed high-level issues in a peer's writing and are accepting of automated feedback, demonstrating that a platform combining peer-review and machine feedback could promote meaningful discussions. We present the results of our mixed-methods investigation that integrates three sources of information: analysis of learners' psychometric constructs, writing samples to identify error patterns, and participatory design group sessions incorporating human-centred design methods. We synthesize our results into four guidelines derived from seven findings resulting from the investigation of a system that scaffolds writing development for mature immigrant ELLs in the absence of formal instructional support. First, we find that ELLs require a platform to collaboratively iterate through the writing process. Next, we suggest how peer feedback can be enhanced through automated support. We then demonstrate how rubric design can guide both linear and holistic peer-review. Finally, we illustrate why open learner models and learning dashboards should contextualize real world progress.

Educational technologies (e.g., learning analytics, student modelling, and intelligent tutoring systems) bring great potential to online education. Many online courses, particularly in self-paced online learning (SPOL), face some inherent barriers such as learning awareness and academic intervention. These barriers can affect the academic performance of online learners. Recently, learning analytics has been shown to have great potential in removing these barriers. However, it is challenging to achieve the full potential of learning analytics with the traditional online course learning design model. Thus, focusing on SPOL, this study proposes that learning analytics should be included in the course learning design loop to ensure data collection and pedagogical connection. We propose a novel learning design-analytics model in which course learning design and learning analytics can support each other to increase learning success. Based on the proposed model, a set of online course design strategies are recommended for online educators who wish to use learning analytics to mitigate the learning barriers in SPOL. These strategies and technologies are inspired by Jim Greer's work on student modelling. By following these recommended design strategies, a computer science course is used as an example to show our initial practices of including learning analytics in the course learning design loop. Finally, future work on how to develop and evaluate learning analytics enabled learning systems is outlined.

Continuously innovation of neural network architectures is making it more correct and efficient every day. But training a neural network from scratch is very time-consuming and requires a lot of sophisticated computational equipment and power. So, using some pre-trained neural network as feature extractor for any image classification task or ""transfer learning"" is a very popular approach that saves time and computational power for practical use of CNNs. In this paper, an efficient way of building full model from any pre-trained model with high accuracy and low memory is proposed using knowledge distillation. Using the distilled knowledge of the last layer of pre-trained networks passes through fully connected layers with different hidden layers, followed by Softmax layer. The accuracies of student networks are mildly lesser than the whole models, but accuracy of student models clearly indicates the accuracy of the real network. In this way, the best number of hidden layers for dense layer for that pre-trained network with best accuracy and no-overfitting can be found with less time. Here, VGG16 and VGG19 (pre-trained upon ""ImageNet"" dataset) is tested upon chest X-rays (pneumonia and COVID-19). For finding the best total number of hidden layers, it saves nearly 44 min for VGG19 and 36 min and 37 s for VGG16 feature extractor.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cin20&AN=154097224&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Yüzyıl; Hâlidîlik; Müderris-Sufi Modeli Medreseli-Cami Modeli; Tasavvuf","Naqshbandi is one of the most widespread Sufi orders in the Islamic World. The most active representative of this sufi order in the Middle East in the 19th century is Mawlana Khalid al- Baghdadî. The Khâlidiyya branch, which was attributed to him, emerged as a Sufi revival movement that revitalized social life with its dynamic structure. One of the most prominent among the activities of the Khâlidiyya is the revival of the madrasahs. Considering that the Khâlidiyya first began to spread in the Shahrazor region of Iraq and among the Kurds living in Iran and Anatolia, the first institutions that it dealt with in the fields of science and education were the Eastern Madrasahs. These madrasahs are science centers established in a wide geography where the Kurdish population is concentrated, such as the Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia regions of Turkey, the northern regions of Iraq and Syria, and western regions of Iran. The Eastern Madrasahs operated as a continuation of the Baghdad Nizamiya Madrasah, which was for Shafiis and all its entire personnel, including teaching staff, were to be selected from Shafii Sect. They consisted mostly of simple structures built next to the mosques, apart from the well-established madrasahs such as Qubbahan Madrasah in İmadiya, Maweran Madrasah in Arbil, Biyara Madrasah in Havraman, Arwas Madrasa in Mokus (Bahçesaray) district of Van, Sheikh Ayn al-Malak Zaviya and Madrasah in Bulanık district of Muş. In the Eastern Madrasahs, where the education is mostly teacher-centered, the circulation of students among the madrasahs was high. In these science centers where students can stay as boarding students, the curriculum of the Baghdad Nizamiya Madrasa and Ottoman period madrasahs were followed. In the Eastern Madrasahs, some classical Works in Persian were preferred in the field of literature, as well as Arabic and religious sciences. In these Madrasahs, the mudarris taught the lessons in Kurdish, and the students discussed and read among themselves in Kurdish. On the one hand the Khâlidis made the existing madrasahs more active; on the other hand, they enabled the opening of many new madrasahs. This situation not only made significant contributions to the scientific and cultural life of the region, but also played a leading role in the formation of an intellectual layer. Managers, scholars, mudarrises, politicians, writers and poets that the society needed were trained in these centers of science, and they filled an important gap in these fields during their lifetime. As the Khâlidi lodges moved from the cities to the countryside, they gave way to modest cells adjacent to madrasahs or mosquest. With the spread of Khâlidiyya, the mudarris-sufi model has increased greatly among the scientists, since the mudarris, who took up education and training in the Eastern Madrasahs, also took on the task of guidance. On the other hand, the disciple-student model has become widespread since the students who received knowledge were brought up in a mystical atmosphere. The tradition of the Eastern Madrasahs is kept alive in mosques in many villages and towns with the Khâlidiyya. In other words, the Khâlidiyya moved the education in the Eastern Madrasahs to mosques and revived the mosques, thus contributing to the proliferation of the madrasah-mosque model in the central and provincial areas. While Mawlana Khalid’s Diwan took its place among the other Persian Works read in madrasahs, a special salawat prayer that Mawlana Khalid recommended to his disciples to read due to the epidemic that broke out in Damascus was started to be read after prayers in mosques and madrasahs where Khâlidi sheikhs served. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of Khâlidiyya on the Eastern Madrasahs, which carry out active education in the triangle of Iraq, Iran and Anatolia. It was concluded that the institutional structure in the Eastern Madrasahs, where scientific and mystical activities were combined, flourished; the curriculum was expanded with works with mystical content; the status of the teaching staff was strengthened with the addition of the guide identity to the mudarrisship; the educational program of the students became more diverse with the provided Sufi education; and the students who grew up in these madrasahs participate in social life as more equipped and self-confident individuals.

Ona nisbet edilen Hâlidiyye kolu, dinamik yapısıyla toplumsal hayatı canlandıran bir tasavvufî ihya hareketi olarak ortaya çıkmıştır. Hâlidîliğin faaliyetleri içinde en çok öne çıkanlardan biri medreselerin ihyasıdır. Hâlidîliğin ilk olarak Irak’ın Şehrezor bölgesi ile İran ve Anadolu’da yaşayan Kürtler arasında yayılmaya başladığı düşünüldüğünde, ilim ve tedrisat olarak ilk el attığı kurumlar Şark Medreseleri olmuştur. Bu medreseler, Türkiye’de Doğu ve Güneydoğu Anadolu bölgeleri, Irak ve Suriye’nin kuzey bölgeleri ile İran’ın batı bölgeleri gibi özellikle Kürt nüfusun yoğunluklu olduğu geniş bir coğrafyada kurulan ilim merkezleridir. Şark Medreseleri, vakfiyesinde Şâfiîler için yaptırıldığı vurgulanan ve müderrisler dahil bütün çalışanlarının Şâfiî mezhebine mensup kişilerden seçilmesi şart koşulan Bağdat Nizamiye Medresesi’nin devamı niteliğinde faaliyet yürütmüştür. İmadiye bölgesindeki Kubbehân Medresesi, Erbil’de bulunan Maveran Medresesi, Hevraman bölgesinde bulunan Biyâre Medresesi, Van’ın Müküs (Bahçesaray) ilçesinde bulunan Arvas Medresesi, Muş’un Bulanık ilçesinde bulunan Şeyh Aynü’l-Melek Zaviye ve Medresesi gibi köklü medreselerin dışındakiler, cami bitişiğinde inşa edilen basit yapılardan oluşmuştur. Tedrisatın çoğunlukla müderris merkezli olduğu Şark Medreselerinde, medreseler arası talebe sirkülasyonu fazla olmuştur. Talebelerin yatılı olarak kalabildiği bu ilim merkezlerinde, müfredat olarak Bağdat Nizamiye Medresesi ile kısmen Osmanlı dönemi medreselerinin ders programları takip edilmiştir. Şark Medreselerinde, Arapça ve dinî ilimlerin yanında edebiyat alanında Farsça bazı klasik eserler tercih edilmiştir. Şark Medreselerinde müderrisler dersleri Kürtçe anlatmış, öğrenciler de kendi aralarında müzakere ve okumaları Kürtçe yapmışlardır. Hâlidîlik, ilmi ve medreseyi önceleyen tavrı ile Şark Medreselerinin niceliğini arttırmış ve ayrı bir dinamizm kazandırmıştır. Hâlidîler bir taraftan mevcut medreseleri daha aktif hale getirirken, diğer taraftan pek çok yeni medresenin açılmasını sağlamışlardır. Bu durum bölgenin ilim ve kültür hayatına önemli katkılar sunduğu gibi entelektüel bir tabakanın oluşmasında da öncü rol oynamıştır. Bu ilim merkezlerinde toplumun ihtiyacı olan yönetici, âlim, müderris, siyasetçi, yazar ve şairler yetişmiş ve yaşadıkları dönem bu alanlarda önemli bir açığı kapatmıştır. Hâlidî tekkeleri, şehirlerden kırsala doğru gittikçe yerini medreselere yahut camilere bitişik mütevazı hücrelere bırakmıştır. Hâlidîliğin yayılmasıyla beraber Şark medreselerinde eğitim ve öğretim işini uhdesine alan müderrisler aynı zamanda irşad görevini de üstlendiklerinden müderris- sûfî modeli ilmiye sınıfı arasında büyük artış göstermiştir. Diğer taraftan ilim tahsil eden talebeler, tasavvufî bir atmosferde yetiştiklerinden mürid-talebe modeli yaygınlaşmıştır. Şark Medrese geleneği, Hâlidîlikle beraber pek çok köy ve beldede camilerde yaşatılmaya başlanmıştır. Diğer bir tabirle Hâlidîler, Şark Medreselerindeki tedrisatı camilere kaydırarak, camileri de canlandırmış, böylece merkez ve taşrada medreseli-cami modelinin çoğalmasına katkı sunmuşlardır. Mevlânâ Hâlid’in Divan’ı, medreselerde okunan diğer Farsça eserler arasında yerini alırken, Mevlânâ Hâlid’in Şam’da baş gösteren salgın sebebiyle müritlerine okumalarını tavsiye ettiği özel bir salavat duası, Hâlidî şeyhlerinin görev yaptıkları cami ve medreselerde namazlardan sonra okunmaya başlanmıştır. Bu çalışmanın amacı Hâlidîliğin Irak, İran ve Anadolu üçgeninde aktif tedrisat yürüten Şark Medreselerine tesirlerini irdelemektir. Hâlidîliğin yayılmasıyla beraber ilmî ve tasavvufî faaliyetlerin mezcedildiği Şark Medreselerinde kurumsal yapının zenginleştiği, tasavvufî içerikli eserlerle müfredatının genişlediği, müderrisliğe mürşid kimliğinin de eklenmesiyle öğretici kadronun statüsünün daha da güçlendiği, verilen tasavvufî eğitimle talebelerin eğitim öğretim programının çeşitlendiği ve bu medreselerde yetişen talebelerin toplumsal hayata daha donanımlı ve özgüvenli bireyler olarak katıldıkları sonucuna ulaşılmıştır.

Based on the Elo model, this study proposes the EELO, an enhanced Elo rating system, in consideration of the application scenarios of polychotomously scored items and multi-dimensional granularity evaluations not covered by the basic Elo rating system. The EELO model estimating students’ cognitive abilities and predicting their future performances on unknown questions is evaluated based on one public set (Assigment2) and one proprietary dataset (HSK), and achieved an AUC of 0.92 for Assigment2 and 0.84 for HSK, which shows that the EELO model has the best performance regarding the above-mentioned objectives as compared with the latest extensions of the IRT and BKT models.

On the one hand, by constructing a learner model and a MOOC resource ontology model, based on the learner's characteristics, the learner's MOOC resource learning preference is predicted, and a recommendation list is formed. On the other hand, the semantic association algorithm is used to calculate the correlation between the MOOC resources to be recommended and the learners' rated resources and predict the learner's learning preferences to form a recommendation list. Finally, the two recommendation lists were comprehensively analyzed to form the final MOOC resource personalized recommendation list. Findings: The semantic association algorithm based on hierarchical correlation analysis and attribute correlation analysis introduced in this study can effectively analyze the semantic similarity between MOOC resources.

This student performance modeling problem is a critical step for building adaptive online teaching systems. Specifically, we conduct a study of how to utilize various types and large amounts of log data from earlier students to train accurate machine learning models that predict the performance of future students. This study is the first to use four very large sets of student data made available recently from four distinct intelligent tutoring systems. Our results include a new machine learning approach that defines a new state of the art for logistic regression based student performance modeling, improving over earlier methods in several ways: First, we achieve improved accuracy of student modeling by introducing new features that can be easily computed from conventional question-response logs (e.g., features such as the pattern in the student's most recent answers). Second, we take advantage of features of the student history that go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., features such as which video segments the student watched, or skipped) as well as background information about prerequisite structure in the curriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized student performance models for different aspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early versus later segments of the student history), then combine these specialized models to create a group prediction of the student performance. Taken together, these innovations yield an average AUC score across these four datasets of 0.808 compared to the previous best logistic regression approach score of 0.767, and also outperforming state-of-the-art deep neural net approaches. Importantly, we observe consistent improvements from each of our three methodological innovations, in each diverse dataset, suggesting that our methods are of general utility and likely to produce improvements for other online tutoring systems as well.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1352163&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

This leads to a situation where ranking models is hard, and the underlying reasons of the models' performance -- be it architectural choices, hyperparameter tuning, performance metrics, or data -- is often underexplored. In this work, we review and evaluate a body of deep learning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models with openly available and widely-used data sets, and with a novel data set of students learning to program. The evaluated knowledge tracing models include Vanilla-DKT, two Long Short-Term Memory Deep Knowledge Tracing (LSTM-DKT) variants, two Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) variants, and SelfAttentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT). As baselines, we evaluate simple non-learning models, logistic regression and Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT). To evaluate how different aspects of DLKT models influence model performance, we test input and output layer variations found in the compared models that are independent of the main architectures. We study maximum attempt count options, including filtering out long attempt sequences, that have been implicitly and explicitly used in prior studies. We contrast the observed performance variations against variations from non-model properties such as randomness and hardware. Performance of models is assessed using multiple metrics, whereby we also contrast the impact of the choice of metric on model performance. The key contributions of this work are the following: Evidence that DLKT models generally outperform more traditional models, but not necessarily by much and not always; Evidence that even simple baselines with little to no predictive value may outperform DLKT models, especially in terms of accuracy -- highlighting importance of selecting proper baselines for comparison; Disambiguation of properties that lead to better performance in DLKT models including metric choice, input and output layer variations, common hyperparameters, random seeding and hardware; Discussion of issues in replicability when evaluating DLKT models, including discrepancies in prior reported results and methodology.

However, developing a skill model and tagging courseware contents with individual skills can be expensive and error prone. We propose a technology to automatically identify latent skills from instructional text on existing online courseware called SMART (Skill Model mining with Automated detection of Resemblance among Texts). SMART is capable of mining, labeling, and mapping skills without using an existing skill model or student learning (aka response) data. The goal of our proposed approach is to mine latent skills from assessment items included in existing courseware, provide discovered skills with human-friendly labels, and map didactic paragraph texts with skills. This way, mapping between assessment items and paragraph texts is formed. In doing so, automated skill models produced by SMART will reduce the workload of courseware developers while enabling adaptive online content at the launch of the course. In our evaluation study, we applied SMART to two existing authentic online courses. We then compared machine-generated skill models and human-crafted skill models in terms of the accuracy of predicting students' learning. We also evaluated the similarity between machine-generated and human-crafted skill models. The results show that student models based on SMART-generated skill models were equally predictive of students' learning as those based on human-crafted skill models--as validated on two OLI (Open Learning Initiative) courses. Also, SMART can generate skill models that are highly similar to human-crafted models as evidenced by the normalized mutual information (NMI) values.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1362652&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Despite the personalized learning afforded by ITSes using adaptive learning, learners are still susceptible to shallow learning. Introducing metacognitive tutoring to teach learners how to be aware of their knowledge can enable deeper learning. However, metacognitive tutoring on top of cognitive tutoring can lead to unsustainable cognitive loads. Using metacognitive inputs for knowledge tracing was explored for managing cognitive loads. Hidden Markov models (HMM) and artificial neural networks were used to train models on a synthetic dataset created from predetermined learner personas. The models created with metacognitive inputs were compared with the models created without said inputs. The models using metacognitive inputs performed better than the standard models while still following learning intuitions. This indicates that combining knowledge tracing and metacognitive tutoring is a viable option for improving learning outcomes. This is an important finding since online learning, which demands metacognitive skills, is becoming popular for various topics, including those that are challenging even with immediate teacher assistance.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1346375&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

A learner model with learning history and its effectiveness plays a significant role in supporting a learner's understanding of their strengths and weaknesses of their way of learning in order to make proper adjustments for improvement. Nowadays, learners have been engaging in online learning frequently and intensely, leaving behind tremendous learning history data that contain informative insights about the learners' learning patterns. This paper proposed a method for developing learner models by applying the Markov chain to learning history data. Our method transforms individual learners' resource use data in a learning course into a large amount of resource use sequences, then develops a Markov learner model, and generates the resource use steady state for each learner. The resource use density, the resource steady state, and the assessment scores of individual learners tell their learning patterns and the effectiveness of the learning patterns. From the Markov learner model, we generate a learner profile for describing learning patterns and an index for measuring the strength of learning habits of the learner. We verified our method by applying it to each course in the OULAD dataset to predict the learning performance using the index. The preliminary results gain up to 97% accuracy on the pass/fail prediction problem.

Text recommendation systems typically classify users and documents into levels, and then match users with documents at the same level. Although this approach can be effective, it has two significant shortcomings. First, the levels assume a standard order of language acquisition and cannot be personalized to the users' learning patterns. Second, recommendation decisions are not transparent because the leveling algorithms can be difficult for users to interpret. We propose a novel method for text recommendation that addresses these two issues. To enhance personalization, an open, editable learner model estimates user knowledge of each word in the foreign language. The documents are ranked by new-word density (NWD) – that is, the percentage of words that are new to the user in the document. The system then recommends documents according to a user-specified target NWD. This design offers complete transparency as users can scrutinize recommendations by reviewing the NWD estimation of the learner model. This article describes an implementation of this method in a mobile app for learners of Chinese as a foreign language. Evaluation results show that users were able to manipulate the learner model and NWD parameters to adjust the difficulty of the recommended documents. In a survey, users reported satisfaction with both the concept and implementation of this text recommendation method.

Furthermore, the study investigates whether a game's aesthetics and mechanics support players' intrinsic motivation. Both claims are tested through the design, implementation and pilot use of the Multiplication Game (MG). MG is a digital learning activity that supports pupils in achieving multiplication competence and provides teacher a dashboard to assess and watch own pupils' performance. The game enriched with gamification elements to engage and motivate participants. Three versions of the game were used by pupils: without any Open Learner Modeling (OLM) support (i.e. without providing access to own progress data), with OLM support and with Open Social Learner Modeling (OSLM) support, to investigate the difference in motivation among these characteristics. After using the MG for a 2-month period, pupils answered a questionnaire anonymously to express their opinion about MG mechanics, MG aesthetics and intrinsic motivation MG can offer. Furthermore, the corresponding teachers were interviewed to provide insights on their attitude towards MG and its functionalities. A statistically significant difference in Intrinsic Motivation (IM) between the three different MG versions was found and a statistically significant difference in MG Aesthetics and Mechanics between the different grades of primary school. Additionally, Intrinsic Motivation was positively correlated with gamification motivators and MG Aesthetics. Participating teachers stated that MG can improve pupils' multiplication competence and it is worthy of a stable place in the instructional procedure, as it is a means of pupils' progress tracking and (self-) assessment, as well as a fun way of practicing and developing multiplication skills.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1330311&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

This paper proposes an architecture, which aims to improve the representation of learning components in a reusable and interoperable way. As a result, these components could be integrated easily for the creation of personalized learning courses.

This study explores the voices of EFL PSTs with regard to their use of Facebook as a tool for promoting their autonomy in learning English, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing upon Betts and Kercher's (1996) Autonomous Learner Model (ALM), this study gained deeper insights into the EFL PSTs' attitudes, perceptions, and ideas concerning the opportunities and challenges Facebook offers them. This qualitative study was based on a purposive sampling of twenty EFL PSTs from a university in northern Thailand. The findings reveal that Thai EFL PSTs experienced all five dimensions of ALM, namely, orientation, individual development, enrichment, seminars, and in-depth study. They also viewed learning English on Facebook positively during the lockdowns since they simultaneously acquired English and enjoyed edutainment resources despite some limitations concerning this platform. Pedagogical implications of this study suggest that Facebook is a suitable platform for ELT professional development and life-long learning, particularly amid the global disruption caused by COVID-19.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1367558&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

In reality, the simple classification model usually shows a high computational performance, but they are limited by low accuracy. In this paper, we use knowledge of the ERNIE model to distill the FastText model; the ERNIE model works as a teacher model to predict the massive online unlabeled data for data enhancement, and then guides the training of the student model of FastText with better computational efficiency. The FastText model is distilled by the ERNIE model in chatbot intention classification.

To what extent learner behavior is defined by known individual differences? Which of them could be a better predictor of learner engagement and performance? Could we use behavior patterns to build a data-driven model of individual differences that could be more useful for predicting critical outcomes of the learning process than traditional models? Our paper attempts to answer these questions using a large volume of learner data collected in an online practice system. We apply a sequential pattern mining approach to build individual models of learner practice behavior and reveal latent student subgroups that exhibit considerably different practice behavior. Using these models we explored the connections between learner behavior and both, the incoming and outgoing parameters of the learning process. Among incoming parameters we examined traditionally collected individual differences such as self-esteem, gender, and knowledge monitoring skills. We also attempted to bridge the gap between cluster-based behavior pattern models and traditional scale-based models of individual differences by quantifying learner behavior on a latent data-driven scale. Our research shows that this data-driven model of individual differences performs significantly better than traditional models of individual differences in predicting important parameters of the learning process, such as performance and engagement.

In essence, KD trains a smaller student model based on a larger teacher model and tries to retain the teacher model's level of performance as much as possible. However, existing KD methods suffer from the following limitations. First, since the student model is smaller in absolute size, it inherently lacks model capacity. Second, the absence of an initial guide for the student model makes it difficult for the student to imitate the teacher model to its fullest. Conventional KD methods yield low performance due to these limitations. In this paper, we propose Pea-KD (Parameter-efficient and accurate Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach to KD. Pea-KD consists of two main parts: Shuffled Parameter Sharing (SPS) and Pretraining with Teacher's Predictions (PTP). Using this combination, we are capable of alleviating the KD's limitations. SPS is a new parameter sharing method that increases the student model capacity. PTP is a KD-specialized initialization method, which can act as a good initial guide for the student. When combined, this method yields a significant increase in student model's performance. Experiments conducted on BERT with different datasets and tasks show that the proposed approach improves the student model's performance by 4.4% on average in four GLUE tasks, outperforming existing KD baselines by significant margins.

Given this goal, an interesting research topic is whether game mechanics that promote learning and those that promote enjoyment have different effects on students' experience and learning performance. We explored these questions in ""Decimal Point,"" a digital learning game that teaches decimal numbers and operations to 5th and 6th graders, through a classroom study with 159 students and two versions of the game. One version encouraged playing and learning through an ""open learner model"" (OLM, N = 55), while one encouraged playing for enjoyment through an analogous ""open enjoyment model"" (OEM, N = 54). We compared these versions to a control version that is neutral with respect to learning and enjoyment (N = 50). While students learned in all three conditions, our results indicated no significant condition differences in learning outcomes, enjoyment, or engagement. However, the learning-oriented group engaged more in re-practicing, while the enjoyment-oriented group demonstrated more exploration of different mini-games. Further analyses of students' interactions with the open learner and enjoyment models revealed that students who followed the learner model demonstrated better in-game learning and test performance, while following the enjoyment model did not impact learning outcomes. These findings indicate that emphasizing learning or enjoyment can lead to distinctive game play behaviors, and that open learner models can be helpful in a learning game context. In turn, our analyses have led to preliminary ideas about how to use AI to provide recommendations that are more aligned with students' dynamic learning and enjoyment states and preferences.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1328318&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

However, constructing tutoring systems that are pedagogically effective has been widely recognized as a challenging problem (Murray 2003; Murray, ""International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education,"" 10, 98-129, 1999). In this paper, we explore the use of computational models of apprentice learning, or computer models that learn interactively from examples and feedback, for authoring expert-models via demonstrations and feedback (Matsuda et al. ""International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education,"" 25(1), 1-34 2014) across a wide range of domains. To support these investigations, we present the Apprentice Learner Architecture, which posits the types of knowledge, performance, and learning components needed for apprentice learning. We use this architecture to create two models: the Decision Tree model, which non-incrementally learns skills, and the Trestle model, which instead learns incrementally. Both models draw on the same small set of prior knowledge (six operators and three types of relational knowledge) to support expert model authoring. Despite their limited prior knowledge, we demonstrate their use for efficiently authoring a novel experimental design tutor and show that they are capable of learning an expert model for seven additional tutoring systems that teach a wide range of knowledge types (associations, categories, and skills) across multiple domains (language, math, engineering, and science). This work shows that apprentice learner models are efficient for authoring tutors that would be difficult to build with existing non-programmer authoring approaches (e.g., experimental design or stoichiometry tutors). Further, we show that these models can be applied to author tutors across eight tutor domains even though they only have a small, fixed set of prior knowledge. This work lays the foundation for new interactive machine-learning based authoring paradigms that empower teachers and other non-programmers to build pedagogically effective educational technologies at scale.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1328308&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Data sources included student models, classroom video, and classroom artifacts. Our analysis revealed a connection between the elicitation of initial ideas, teacher responsiveness to those ideas, and the continued use of those ideas by the students across the unit as evidenced in their individually constructed models. In both classrooms, variation in initial ideas seen on the first day narrowed as students engaged in activities designed to challenge their ideas and present the scientifically accepted explanation of the phenomenon. In one classroom, however, far more ideas were surfaced early, and those ideas were utilized by students as they made sense of the phenomenon. In the other classroom, far fewer ideas were surfaced early and those that were all but disappeared once the unit activities began suggesting student ideas were less likely to be utilized as a sense‐making resource. This study contributes to a growing understanding of the importance of eliciting and responding to students' initial ideas in students' productive disciplinary engagement across an instructional unit.

These models capture students' learning interactions and store them in the form of a set of binary responses, thereby failing to utilize rich educational information in the learning process. Moreover, the recent development of these models has been focused on improving the prediction performance and tended to adopt deep neural networks in building the end-to-end prediction frameworks. Although this approach can provide an improved prediction performance, it may also cause difficulties in interpreting the student's learning status, which is crucial for providing personalized educational feedback. To address this problem, this paper provides an interpretable cognitive model named HELP-DKT, which can infer how students learn programming based on deep knowledge tracing. HELP-DKT has two major advantages. First, it implements a feature-rich input layer, where the raw codes of students are encoded to vector representations, and the error classifications as concept indicators are incorporated. Second, it can infer meaningful estimation of student abilities while reliably predicting future performance. The experiments confirm that HELP-DKT can achieve good prediction performance and present reasonable interpretability of student skills improvement. In practice, HELP-DKT can personalize the learning experience of novice learners. © 2022.

However, using the off-the-shelf models against fundus image datasets of different races may lead to degraded performance due to domain shift. To address the issue, this paper proposes a dual-tutor student learning network (DSLN) for multiracial glaucoma detection. The proposed DSLN consists of an inter-image tutor, an intra-image tutor, student model and backbone network, which combines the advantages of domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. The inter-image tutor uses CycleGAN for style transfer to reduce the appearance differences between labeled source domain and labeled target domain images, and transfers the learned knowledge to the student model by minimizing knowledge distillation loss. The intra-image tutor adopts the exponential moving average to leverage the unlabeled target domain and transfers the knowledge to the student model by minimizing prediction consistency loss. Moreover, the student model not only directly learns knowledge from the labeled target domain images, but also learns the intra-image knowledge and inter-image knowledge transfer by two tutors. Furthermore, the backbone integrates the context features of the local optic disc region and global fundus image via modified ResNet50. We conduct extensive experiments on three scenarios constructed from nine public fundus image datasets of three races. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed DSLN framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models and has good robustness and generalization: it can effectively overcome domain shift and accurately detect glaucoma from multi-ethnic fundus images.

However, the adaptation of student models in different domains/courses needs a balance between the generalization and context specificity to reduce the redundancy in creating domain-specific models. This paper explores the predictive power and generalization of a feature - context-bound cognitive skill score- in estimating the likelihood of success or failure of a student in a traditional higher education course so that the appropriate intervention is provided to help the students. To identify the students at risk in different courses, we applied classification algorithms on context-bound cognitive skill scores of a student to estimate the chances of success or failure, especially failure. The context-bound cognitive skill scores were aggregated based on the learning objective of a course to generate meaningful visual feedback to teachers and students so that they can understand why some students are predicted to be at risk. Evaluation of the generated model shows that this feature is applicable in a range of courses, and it mitigates the effort in engineering features/models for each domain. We submit that overall, context-bound cognitive skill scores prove to be effective in flagging the student performance when the accurate metrics related to learning activities and social behaviors of the students are unavailable.

The benefit of knowledge tracing is that students' learning plans can be better organised and adjusted, and interventions can be made when necessary. With the recent rise of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) has utilised Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to accomplish this task with some success. Other works have attempted to introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and redefine the task accordingly to achieve significant improvements. However, these efforts suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (1) they pay too much attention to details of the nodes rather than to high-level semantic information; (2) they struggle to effectively establish spatial associations and complex structures of the nodes; and (3) they represent either concepts or exercises only, without integrating them. Inspired by recent advances in self-supervised learning, we propose a Bi -Graph C ontrastive L earning based K nowledge T racing (Bi-CLKT) to address these limitations. Specifically, we design a two-layer comparative learning scheme based on an ""exercise-to-exercise"" (E2E) relational subgraph. It involves node-level contrastive learning of subgraphs to obtain discriminative representations of exercises, and graph-level contrastive learning to obtain discriminative representations of concepts. Moreover, we designed a joint contrastive loss to obtain better representations and hence better prediction performance. Also, we explored two different variants, using RNN and memory-augmented neural networks as the prediction layer for comparison to obtain better representations of exercises and concepts respectively. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed Bi-CLKT and its variants outperform other baseline models.

While providing convenience to users, online learning systems also bring troubles to users, who cannot quickly find the resources they are interested in from the huge amount of learning resources. In this paper, we apply deep learning to an English online learning platform and analyze learners and learning contents by clustering algorithm and association rules. Based on this, a content organization system is developed using genetic algorithms, which is applied to the case of this paper to provide learners with personalized learning content. With the hope that the system can be extended to other online learning platforms in the future, three data mining techniques were selected to solve the problems found in the English online learning platform, and we designed how these techniques should be applied to the online learning platform. The first technique is the cluster mining technique, which is used to analyze learners' profiles, classify learners in different categories, provide them with personalized learning content, and organize group learning. The second technique is association rules, which is used to analyze the correlation between learning contents. For the adaptive student-teacher knowledge migration strategy, the teacher model can guide the student model to track online and migrate the task-specific knowledge to the online tracking student model through the network parameters. Finally, a case study is selected and the above design is applied to this case study, and the results are analyzed in detail. The data mining technology is applied to the English online learning platform, and an innovative English learning content organization system is developed.

With the emergence of intelligent educational systems, numerous research works are dedicated to Knowledge Tracing (KT), which refers to the issue of diagnosing students' changing knowledge proficiency in exercises. Recent developments in KT have yielded immense success on this task and they mainly use sophisticated and flexible deep neural network-based models to fully exploit the interaction information between students and response logs. However, these models either ignore the significance of Q-matrix associated exercises with knowledge concepts (KCs) or fail to avoid the subjective tendency of experts within the Q-matrix. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we devise a novel Calibrated Q-matrix-based Knowledge Tracing (CQKT) framework to track knowledge proficiency of students dynamically in KT. To be specific, for the original Q-matrix, we primarily strive to capture the high-order connectivity between exercises and KCs to obtain potential KCs of each exercise by utilizing graph convolution network. Then, three Q-matrix calibration methods based on a pairwise Bayesian treatment equipped with potential KCs are adopted to refine and calibrate the raw Q-matrix so that the subjective tendency of the Q-matrix defined by domain experts can be weakened. After that, the embedding of each exercise aggregated the calibrated Q-matrix with historical student interactions is injected into the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to trace students' knowledge states. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world benchmark datasets and the results show the superiority of CQKT. In particular, we demonstrate its practicability via applying it to three fundamental educational tasks, including score prediction, knowledge state estimation, and diagnosis result visualization.

Over the past decades, several platforms have been proposed to support the peer assessment process. The current landscape is dominated by special-purpose, context-specific peer evaluation systems, which were designed to support a particular type of learning activity, artifact, or discipline. In this article, we propose an alternative, a generic and comprehensive peer assessment platform, called LearnEval, which is very flexible and able to accommodate a variety of pedagogical scenarios. Distinctive functionalities include: highly configurable peer assessment workflow, several automatic and manual review allocation mechanisms, initial calibration/training options for the students, complex dashboard with statistics, scores and graphical visualizations, as well as an extensive open learner model. The platform was developed in an iterative manner, with several extensions and improvements informed by the findings of the initial pilot studies. The article also reports on a practical application of LearnEval in a project-based learning scenario, with very promising results; multiple perspectives of the peer assessment process are analyzed: student behavior, peer grades validity, and perceived learning experience. Comparative results with an earlier study show increased levels of system usability, grading validity, and student satisfaction.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1344441&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Existing research tends to focus on the identification of threshold concepts within undergraduate curricula as challenging concepts that prevent attainment of subsequent content until mastered. Recently, threshold concepts have likewise become a research focus at the level of doctoral studies. However, such research faces several limitations. First, the generalizability of findings in past research has been limited due to the relatively small numbers of participants in available studies. Second, it is not clear which specific skills are contingent upon mastery of identified threshold concepts, making it difficult to identify appropriate times for possible intervention. Third, threshold concepts observed across disciplines may or may not mask important nuances that apply within specific disciplinary contexts. The current study therefore employs a novel Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) approach to identify possible threshold concepts using a large data set from the biological sciences. Using rubric-scored samples of doctoral students' sole-authored scholarly writing, we apply BKT as a strategy to identify potential threshold concepts by examining the ability of performance scores for specific research skills to predict score gains on other research skills. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy, as well as convergence between results of the current study and more conventional, qualitative results identifying threshold concepts at the doctoral level.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1336809&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

It requires a well-trained and high-performance model in advance, which limits the application of the deep model in some multimedia devices. However, the powerful teacher is not always available. Given this, some researchers propose a strategy of learning from each student model to replace the traditional teacher–student learning paradigm. Although this way has achieved good results recently, the simple mutual learning between student networks is easy to reach saturation earlier. In this work, we propose a smarter mutual learning method called Smarter Peer Learning (SPL) for online knowledge distillation, which puts forward a weight evaluation mechanism to build a virtual teacher and a novel online distillation framework. The ensemble teacher is constructed by combining the output of student networks through the calculated weight so that students will learn more from the better performance peers in the next stage of the learning. The experiments show that our SPL can train more efficient students than some existing advanced methods by applying various backbone networks to CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.

The models will tend to give good results in classes where there are many examples and poor results in those with few examples. This problem generally occurs when the classes to predict are imbalanced and this is frequent in educational data where for example, there are skills that are very difficult or very easy to master. There will be less data on students that correctly answered questions related to difficult skills and who incorrectly answered those related to skills easy to master. In this paper, we tackled this problem by proposing a hybrid architecture combining Deep Neural Network architectures- especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-with expert knowledge for user modeling. The proposed solution uses attention mechanism to infuse expert knowledge into the Deep Neural Network. It has been tested in two contexts: knowledge tracing in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) called Logic-Muse and prediction of socio-moral reasoning in a serious game called MorALERT. The proposed solution is compared to state-of-the-art machine learning solutions and experiments show that the resulting model can accurately predict the current student's knowledge state (in Logic-Muse) and thus enable an accurate personalization of the learning process. Other experiments show that the model can also be used to predict the level of socio-moral reasoning skills (in MorALERT). Our findings suggest the need for hybrid neural networks that integrate prior expert knowledge (especially when it is necessary to compensate for the strong dependency-of deep learning methods-on data size or the possible unbalanced datasets). Many domains can benefit from such an approach to building models that allow generalization even when there are small training data.

Despite the multiple deep knowledge tracing (DKT) methods developed for intelligent tutoring systems and online learning environments, there exists only a few applications of such methods in educational computer games. One key challenge is that a player may deploy several interweaved and overlapped skills during gameplay, making the assessment task nontrivial. In this research, we present a generalizable DKT approach called GameDKT that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning with domain knowledge to model the learners' knowledge state during gameplay, in an attempt to monitor and trace their proficiency level for the different skills required for educational games. Our findings reveal that GameDKT approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated CNN model with accuracy and AUC of roughly 85% and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the MLP baseline model by up to 14%. When the performance of players is forecasted for up to four game tasks in advance, results show that the CNN model can achieve more than 70% accuracy. Interestingly, this model seems to be better and faster at identifying local patterns and it could achieve a higher performance compared to RNN and LSTM in both one-step and multi-step prediction of learners' performance in game tasks.

How to mine and analyze education big data has become an urgent problem in the field of education and big data knowledge engineering. As for the dynamic learning data, knowledge tracing aims to track learners' knowledge status over time by analyzing the learners' exercise data, so as to predict their performance in the next time step. Deep learning knowledge tracking performs well, but they mainly model the knowledge components while ignoring the personalized information of questions and learners, and provide limited interpretability in the interaction between learners' knowledge status and questions. A context-aware attentive knowledge query network (CAKQN) model is proposed in this paper, which combines flexible neural network models with interpretable model components inspired by psychometric theory. We use the Rasch model to regularize the embedding of questions and learners' interaction tuples, and obtain personalized representations from them. In addition, the long-term short-term memory network and monotonic attention mechanism are used to mine the contextual information of learner interaction sequences and question sequences. It can not only retain the ability to model sequences, but also use the monotonic attention mechanism with exponential decay term to extract the hidden forgetting behavior and other characteristics of learners in the learning process. Finally, the vector dot product is used to simulate the interaction between the learners' knowledge state and questions to improve the interpretability. A series of experimental results on 4 real-world online learning datasets show that CAKQN has the best performance, and its AUC value is improved by an average of 2.945% compared with the existing optimal model. Furthermore, the CAKQN proposed in this paper can not only track learners' knowledge status like other models but also model learners' forgetting behavior. In the future, our research will have high application value in the realization of personalized learning strategies, teaching interventions, and resource recommendations for intelligent online education platforms.

CMKT considers the concept map as a new information source and explicitly exploits its inherent information to help the estimation of the learner's knowledge state. Specifically, the pairwise educational relations in the concept map are formulated as the ordering pairs and are used as mathematical constraints for model construction. The topology information in the concept map is extracted and used as the model input by employing the network embedding techniques. Integrating both educational relation information and topology information in the concept map, CMKT adopts the recurrent neural network to perform knowledge tracing tasks. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on five public educational datasets of four different subjects (more than 8000 learners and their 300,000 records) demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of CMKT: The average area under ROC curve (AUC) and overall prediction accuracy (ACC) achieve 0.82 and 0.75, respectively, and CMKT outperforms all the baselines by at least 12.2% and 9.2% in terms of AUC and ACC.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1348454&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Although the prediction accuracy has been improved by knowledge tracing models established on the basis of students' historical learning data, how to design and apply personalized learning recommendation by combining classroom teaching of higher education is a great difficulty. To recommend personalized learning resources meeting the teaching requirements in higher education, the Q-LRDP-D (Learning Resource Difficulty Prediction and Dijkstra based on Q matrix) algorithm was proposed in this study. First, learning resources were modeled in accordance with Q matrix theory. Then, students' learning difficulty was predicted through the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm of a learning resource difficulty prediction module, followed by cyclic prediction through combining the to-be-learned knowledge points as required by teaching units to form a directed path diagram of learning resources. Next, the least learning resources conforming to students' learning levels were recommended using the shortest path algorithm to complete learning tasks. Lastly, the accuracy and effectiveness of the established model were verified through undergraduate teaching experiments. Results demonstrate that the modeling of learning resources in higher education on the basis of Q matrix theory is applicable to the LSTM algorithm. In comparison with the benchmark algorithm, its precision is obviously improved. With the recommendation algorithm, the average return on learning resources in the experimental class is 6.31, which is considerably higher than that in the control group. This study provides a certain reference for improving students' learning efficiency through recommendation algorithms in higher education and teaching.

However, one crucial enhancement is that they should take into consideration important aspects of each individual student and adapt to them accordingly for improving the educational results. Given the above, the present work considers an educational adventure game that offers cognitive-based adaptivity in its educational content and scenarios. More specifically, it adapts both the difficulty level of the educational content and its plot dynamically to the knowledge level and learning needs of each individual student. The adaptation is realized using a fuzzy student model that detects the current cognitive state of the trainee and decides about the way in which the game's plot has to be modified. It determines if its scenario will be dynamically extended or not, aiming to assist the trainee overcome her/his weaknesses and improve her/his educational performance. The gain of this is that through the plot's adaptation, the game motivates the learners/players to be involved actively in the learning process and provides educational content tailored to their knowledge level and weaknesses, enhancing the educational results.

Secondly, starting from the actual teaching, we analyze the functional requirements and performance requirements of the system in detail and make detailed planning and design for the system architecture, database selection, functional modules, etc. The design and implementation process of this teaching system are summarized. The teaching strategy inference engine is the key to the personalization and intelligence of the ICAI system. According to the learning models provided by different students, the system designs a corresponding teaching sequence for the learners by controlling the meta-knowledge of the domain knowledge base. The teaching strategy inference engine cuts the domain knowledge tree, selects the knowledge points suitable for the student, and sorts the selected knowledge points reasonably to generate an optimal teaching sequence. According to the students' learning situation, combined with the teaching rules in the teaching rule library, the students' grades are dynamically adjusted, so as to select new learning content for students and provide teaching suggestions in time. The student model is the premise of the ICAI system to achieve individualization and intelligence. The system makes a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis of students through fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and fuzzy reasoning.

In recent years, deep neural network-based methods have achieved sound performance on this task because they have a powerful feature representation learning ability. However, two main problems hinder the further development of the existing deep learning-based Knowledge Tracing methods. The first problem is that the interaction history is treated as an ordered sequence, which ignores the individual time intervals between each interaction. The second problem is that higher-order temporal features for knowledge tracing have not been extensively explored. In this paper, to address these problems, we propose a method called the Time Interval Aware Self-Attention approach for Knowledge Tracing (TISAKT), which takes the relationship between exercises into consideration. More specifically, firstly, the relationship between exercises is modeled from the interactions introduced into the absolute positions and the time intervals of answered exercises at the same time. Then, temporal features are exploited implicitly by a temporal convolutional network. Extensive experiments on the two real-world datasets show that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing methods.

According to the recent studies on feature-based knowledge distillation (KD), a student model will not be able to imitate a teacher's behavior properly if there is a high variance between the inner layers of the teacher and those of the student in terms of spatial shapes. This paper proposes a hypothesis that breaking down the knowledge of feature maps from a teacher's inner layers and then distilling this knowledge into a student's inner layers can bridge the gap between an advanced teacher and a student. Improving a student's performance, this process can also help the student model better comprehend the knowledge. Hence, this paper embeds feature-based KD modules between a teacher model and a student model. In addition to extracting a tensor of feature maps in a teacher's inner layers, these modules are responsible for breaking down this high-dimensional tensor through high-order rank singular value decomposition and then distilling the useful knowledge from the teacher's feature maps into the student. According to various evaluations on two benchmark datasets in Experimental Results and Paired t-Test , adding the tensor decomposition approach to the feature-based KD module had a major role in enhancing the performance of a student model which showed competitive outputs in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

The learning model devised in this study reflects the characteristics of technological problem-solving as it considers all areas of cognition, definition, and psychodynamics. Among the dimensions of recognition, judgment, creativity, execution, attitude, and interaction of technological problem-solving learning styles, the dimensions that acted mainly according to the content of the problem and the learning type could be selected and constructed as a model. In this study, a creativity-execution model was devised in consideration of the 'adaptationinnovation type' of the creativity level and the 'reflection-action type' of the execution level. In addition, an interactive-attitude model was devised in which the 'independent-cooperative type' in the interaction dimension and the 'avoidance-participation type' in the attitude dimension act dynamically. Furthermore, a three-factor learner model was developed considering the dimensions of cognitive judgment, creativity, and execution. Also, a five-factor learner model for technological problem-solving was devised and presented, with all five dimensions of cognition-judgment, creativity, execution, interaction, and attitude of the technological problem-solving learning style as factors. The learner characteristics defined through the model design suggested the direction of AI convergence education considering individual characteristics of learners and provided basic data for it.

However, most of the models do not consider two typical situations in real-life classrooms. The first is that teachers develop their own questions for online formative assessment. Therefore, there are a huge number of possible questions, each of which is answered by only a few students. Second, online formative assessment often involves open-ended questions that students answer in writing. These types of questions in online formative assessment are highly valuable. However, analyzing the responses automatically can be a complex process. In this paper, we address these two challenges. We analyzed 621,575 answers to closed-ended questions and 16,618 answers to open-ended questions by 464 fourth-graders from 24 low socioeconomic status (SES) schools. Using regressors obtained from linguistic features of the answers and an automatic incoherent response classifier, we built a linear model that predicts the score on an end-of-year national standardized test. We found that despite answering 36.4 times fewer open-ended questions than closed questions, including features of the students' open responses in our model improved our prediction of their end-of-year test scores. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a predictor of end-of-year test scores has been improved by using automatically detected features of answers to open-ended questions on online formative assessments.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=36278604&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies.

Despite an accurate predictive performance of such models, it is challenging to interpret their behaviors and obtain an intuitive insight into latent student learning status. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new learner modeling framework named the EAKT, which embeds a structured cognitive model into a transformer. In this way, the EAKT not only can achieve an excellent prediction result of learning outcome but also can depict students' knowledge state on a multi-dimensional knowledge component(KC) level. By performing the fine-grained analysis of the student learning process, the proposed framework provides better explanatory learner models for designing and implementing intelligent tutoring systems. The proposed EAKT is verified by experiments. The performance experiments show that the EAKT can better predict the future performance of student learning(more than 2.6% higher than the baseline method on two of three real-world datasets). The interpretability experiments demonstrate that the student knowledge state obtained by EAKT is closer to ground truth than other models, which means EAKT can more accurately trace changes in the students' knowledge state. © 2022.

Assessing and identifying the effects of student characteristics is important for online educational systems. Machine learning (ML) is becoming significant in utilizing learning data for student modeling, decision support systems, adaptive systems, and evaluation systems. The growing need for dynamic assessment of student characteristics in online educational systems has led to application of machine learning methods in modeling the characteristics. Being able to automatically model student characteristics during learning processes is essential for dynamic and continuous adaptation of teaching and learning to each student's needs. This paper provides a review of 8 years (from 2015 to 2022) of literature on the application of machine learning methods for automatic modeling of various student characteristics. The review found six student characteristics that can be modeled automatically and highlighted the data types, collection methods, and machine learning techniques used to model them. Researchers, educators, and online educational systems designers will benefit from this study as it could be used as a guide for decision-making when creating student models for adaptive educational systems. Such systems can detect students' needs during the learning process and adapt the learning interventions based on the detected needs. Moreover, the study revealed the progress made in the application of machine learning for automatic modeling of student characteristics and suggested new future research directions for the field. Therefore, machine learning researchers could benefit from this study as they can further advance this area by investigating new, unexplored techniques and find new ways to improve the accuracy of the created student models.

The learning process is essentially the pairwise interactions of Students, Concepts, and Questions (S–C, S–Q, C–Q for short). Modeling all these interactions will improve the performance of KT. However, existing KT methods hardly exploit all the interactions in a single model. Specifically, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and most of its variants neglect C–Q; Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and other deep neural network approaches mostly neglect S–Q and C–Q. We propose the Ensemble Knowledge Tracing (EnKT), which models all three types of interactions. The base model of EnKT is a hybrid of BKT and DKT. We also present an ensemble algorithm Recurrent Boosting (RB), which extends AdaBoost to deal with KT sequential data. Inspired by BKT, EnKT represents S–C and S–Q using learning and performance parameters, respectively. Besides, EnKT defines C–Q as the correlation complexity among the concepts involved in a question. Experiments show EnKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (by up to 6% in AUC in some cases) on four real-world benchmark datasets and illustrate better interpretability by several typical case studies. • Our model represents the interactions among students, concepts and questions. • Our model can help teachers understand the status of students. • Our model transforms AdaBoost to deal with sequential data. • Our model outperforms the traditional knowledge tracing models.

From these, it is possible to infer information about the progress of the student to provide help targeted both, trainers who must make adaptive tutoring decisions for each learner, and students to detect and correct their learning weaknesses. For the correct development of any of these tasks, it is important to have a suitable student model that allows the representation of the most significant information possible about the student. Additionally, it would be very advantageous for this modeling to incorporate mechanisms from which it would be possible to infer more information about the student's state of knowledge. To facilitate this goal, in this paper a new approach to develop an adaptive competence-based recommender system is proposed. We present a methodological development guide as well as a set of ontological and non-ontological resources to develop and adapt the prototype of the proposed recommender system. A modular flexible ontology network previously built for this purpose has been extended, which is responsible for recording the instructional design and student information. Furthermore, we describe a case study based on a first aid learning experience to assess the prototype with the proposed methodology. We highlight the relevance of flexibility and adaptability in learning modeling and recommendation processes. In order to promote improvement in the personalized learning of students, we present a Recommender System prototype taking advantages of ontologies, with a methodological guide, a broad taxonomy of recommendation criteria and the nature of competences. Future lines of research lines, including a more comprehensive evaluation of the system, will allow us to demonstrate in depth its adaptability according to the characteristics of the student, flexibility and extensibility for its integration in various environments and domains. • Competences are an interesting pedagogical support for diagnosis or recommendation. • An adaptive Competence-based Recommender System prototype is presented. • Methodological guide to develop and adapt to multiple environments and domains. • Student modeling, ontology network and non-monotonic diagnosis, is the system core. • Ontology network and diagnosis rules, previously built, are extended and adapted.

The learning behaviours data describes three main types of learning behaviours: learning process, learning end, and learning interval. The classical knowledge tracing models only use the data of the learning end, which contains limited information and the models cannot accurately describe constraint in the same learning behaviour in the time series. Subsequent models add other types of learning behaviours data but do not integrate different types of learning behaviours, and the models cannot accurately describe collaboration in different learning behaviours. To address these issues, knowledge tracing via attention-enhanced encoder-decoder is proposed to synthesize and analyse the three types of learning behaviours mentioned above and firstly adopts the multiheaded attention mechanism to describe constraint in the same learning behaviours; secondly adopts the channel attention mechanism modelling collaboration in the three types of learning behaviours. In the experiments, various comparisons are made with related models on several real data sets, and the results show that our model achieves certain advantages in terms of performance and knowledge state representation.

The study's objective is to compare the strength of associations between standardized patient (SP) satisfaction with simulated genetic counseling sessions and student skill use during the sessions, as reported by SPs and students. We hypothesized that (1) Both SP- and student-reported skill use will be significantly associated with SP satisfaction ratings during the baseline simulation and (2): SP ratings of student skill use will show a stronger relationship to SP satisfaction than student self-rating of skill use. Sixty genetic counseling students and recent graduates (referred to as ""students"") from accredited U.S. and Canadian programs participated in the study and completed a baseline virtual-simulated genetic counseling session. Both students and SPs completed post-session questionnaires about communication skill use (a 22-item checklist) and SPs completed a satisfaction questionnaire based on the session (a 14-item Likert scale). Multilevel regression models assessed associations between SP satisfaction during the baseline session and SP- or student-reported skill use. SP satisfaction was significantly associated with skill use reported by both SPs and students, but the model based on SP report explained a higher proportion of the variance in SP satisfaction than student-reported skill use (SP model fixed effects R 2 = 27%, adjusted R 2 = 21%; vs. student model R 2 = 7%, adjusted R 2 = -2%). For both the SP and student models, use of more skills from the LISTEN domain (which focused on eliciting the patient's perspective) was associated with higher SP satisfaction, while other skill category domains were not. These findings support the SP satisfaction measure as sensitive to variation in student performance of key communication skills, especially those eliciting the patient's perspective. Moreover, SP assessment of session satisfaction can be a useful assessment of student communication performance and a meaningful proxy for actual patient satisfaction. © 2022 National Society of Genetic Counselors.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=36537339&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The existing literature maintains that the learner model represents the basis and the key to adaptation. To achieve this goal, we propose a new adaptation aspect of the learner model by integrating relevant information such as learning style, domain-related data, assessment-related data, and affective data. It has advantages in terms of precision as it solves the problem of management uncertainty of some parameters.

Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown promise. However, optimizing DL models requires setting numerous parameters, and demands substantial labeled datasets, which are labor-intensive to create. Objective: This study proposes a semi-supervised model that can utilize labeled and unlabeled data to accurately segment kidneys, tumors, and cysts on CT images, even with limited labeled samples. Methods: An end-to-end semi-supervised learning model named MTAN (Mean Teacher Attention N-Net) is designed to segment kidneys, tumors, and cysts on CT images. The MTAN model is built on the foundation of the AN-Net architecture, functioning dually as teachers and students. In its student role, AN-Net learns conventionally. In its teacher role, it generates objects and instructs the student model on their utilization to enhance learning quality. The semi-supervised nature of MTAN allows it to effectively utilize unlabeled data for training, thus improving performance and reducing overfitting. Results: We evaluate the proposed model using two CT image datasets (KiTS19 and KiTS21). In the KiTS19 dataset, MTAN achieved segmentation results with an average Dice score of 0.975 for kidneys and 0.869 for tumors, respectively. Moreover, on the KiTS21 dataset, MTAN demonstrates its robustness, yielding average Dice scores of 0.977 for kidneys, 0.886 for masses, 0.861 for tumors, and 0.759 for cysts, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed MTAN model presents a compelling solution for accurate medical image segmentation, particularly in scenarios where the labeled data is scarce. By effectively utilizing the unlabeled data through a semi-supervised learning approach, MTAN mitigates overfitting concerns and achieves high-quality segmentation results. The consistent performance across two distinct datasets, KiTS19 and KiTS21, underscores model's reliability and potential for clinical reference.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=37718833&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Addressing this dilemma is particularly challenging in open-ended domains, where there can be several ways to solve problems. Researchers have explored methods to determine when to proactively help students, but few of these methods have taken prior hint usage into account. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach to incorporate students' hint usage in predicting their need for help. We explore its impact in an intelligent tutor that deals with the open-ended and well-structured domain of logic proofs. We present a controlled study to investigate the impact of an adaptive hint policy based on predictions of HelpNeed that incorporate students' hint usage. We show empirical evidence to support that such a policy can save students a significant amount of time in training and lead to improved posttest results, when compared to a control without proactive interventions. We also show that incorporating students' hint usage significantly improves the adaptive hint policy's efficacy in predicting students' HelpNeed, thereby reducing training unproductivity, reducing possible help avoidance, and increasing possible help appropriateness (a higher chance of receiving help when it was likely to be needed). We conclude with suggestions on the domains that can benefit from this approach as well as the requirements for adoption. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=35966028&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

This has resulted in a considerable digital divide between patient care and education, one that poorly serves practitioners and organizations, even as learning becomes ever more important to both. In this perspective, we advocate for the enhancement of existing health information systems so that they intentionally facilitate learning. We describe three well-regarded frameworks for learning that can point toward how health care information systems can best evolve to support learning. The Master Adaptive Learner model suggests ways that the individual practitioner can best organize their activities to ensure continual self-improvement. The PDSA cycle similarly proposes actions for improvement but at a health care organization's workflow level. Senge's Five Disciplines of the Learning Organization, a more general framework from the business literature, serves to further inform how disparate information and knowledge flows can be managed for continual improvement. Our main thesis holds that these types of learning frameworks should inform the design and integration of information systems serving the health professions. An underutilized mediator of educational improvement is the ubiquitous electronic health record. The authors list learning analytic opportunities, including potential modifications of learning management systems and the electronic health record, that would enhance health professions education and support the shared goal of delivering high-quality evidence-based health care.

This paper proposes an adaptive personalized E-learning platform with a novel combination of Visual/Aural/Read, Write/Kinesthetic (VARK) presentation or gamification and exercises difficulty scaffolding through skipping/hiding/ reattempting. Cognitive, behavior and affective adaptation means are included in developing a dynamic learner model, which detects and corrects each student's learning style and cognitive level. As adaptation targets, the platform provides adaptive content presentation in two groups (VARK and gamification), adaptive exercises navigation and adaptive feedback. To achieve its goal, the platform utilizes a Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning (DQN-RL) and an online rule-based decision making implementation. The platform interfaces front-end dedicated website and back-end adaptation algorithms. An improvement in learning effectiveness is achieved comparing the post-test to the pre-test in a pilot experiment for grade 3 mathematics curriculum. Both groups witnessed academic performance and satisfaction level improvements, most importantly, for the students who started the experiment with a relatively low performance. VARK group witnessed a slightly more improvement and higher satisfaction level, since interactive activities and games in the kinesthetic presentation can provide engagement, while keeping other presentation styles available, when needed. © The Author(s) 2022.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=35789938&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

To support individualised learning and support proactive scaffolding when students are struggling, game‐based learning environments should be able to accurately predict student knowledge at early points in students' gameplay. Student knowledge is traditionally assessed prior to and after each student interacts with the learning environment with conventional methods, such as multiple choice content knowledge assessments. While previous student modelling approaches have leveraged machine learning to automatically infer students' knowledge, there is limited work that incorporates the fine‐grained content from each question in these types of tests into student models that predict student performance at early junctures in gameplay episodes. This work investigates a predictive student modelling approach that leverages the natural language text of the post‐gameplay content knowledge questions and the text of the possible answer choices for early prediction of fine‐grained individual student performance in game‐based learning environments. With data from a study involving 66 undergraduate students from a large public university interacting with a game‐based learning environment for microbiology, Crystal Island, we investigate the accuracy and early prediction capacity of student models that use a combination of gameplay features extracted from student log files as well as distributed representations of post‐test content assessment questions. The results demonstrate that by incorporating knowledge about assessment questions, early prediction models are able to outperform competing baselines that only use student game trace data with no question‐related information. Furthermore, this approach achieves high generalisation, including predicting the performance of students on unseen questions. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic A distinctive characteristic of game‐based learning environments is their capacity to enable fine‐grained student assessment.Adaptive game‐based learning environments offer individualisation based on specific student needs and should be able to assess student competencies using early prediction models of those competencies.Word embedding approaches from the field of natural language processing show great promise in the ability to encode semantic information that can be leveraged by predictive student models.What this paper adds Investigates word embeddings of assessment question content for reliable early prediction of student performance.Demonstrates the efficacy of distributed word embeddings of assessment questions when used by early prediction models compared to models that use either no assessment information or discrete representations of the questions.Demonstrates the efficacy and generalisability of word embeddings of assessment questions for predicting the performance of both new students on existing questions and existing students on new questions.Implications for practice and/or policy Word embeddings of assessment questions can enhance early prediction models of student knowledge, which can drive adaptive feedback to students who interact with game‐based learning environments.Practitioners should determine if new assessment questions will be developed for their game‐based learning environment, and if so, consider using our student modelling framework that incorporates early prediction models pretrained with existing student responses to previous assessment questions and is generalisable to the new assessment questions by leveraging distributed word embedding techniques.Researchers should consider the most appropriate way to encode the assessment questions in ways that early prediction models are able to infer relationships between the questions and gameplay behaviour to make accurate predictions of student competencies.

The analysis of the semantic path of a learner or group of learners during the learning process can allow detecting those students who are in needs of help as well as identify the insufficiently mastered concepts. We examine the possibility of using a student's browsing path during a learning session, based on his navigation traces, to update the learner model. We assume that the domain concepts examined outside the learning platform but that are related to the course concepts are problematic to the learner. Knowing about these concepts may allow the course's author to adapt the course to the learner's needs regarding these concepts, as well as allow the tutor to help and assist the learner on these problematic concepts. We rely on Web data mining methods to filter, organize, and analyze the student's browsing path. More precisely, we use a domain ontology of the course and the similarities that exist between external documents (visited pages) and the domain concepts (the course keywords). This analysis process makes it possible to detect students' learning difficulties and to adapt the course based on the learner's model.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1361083&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The produced multimodal data is used to uncover cognitive, behavioural, and affective processes during the embodied learning activity. However, the use of eye-tracking data presenting visual attention to understand students' behaviours and learning performance during engagement with tangible learning activity is rather unexplored. Therefore, this paper explores the integration of eye-gaze features to predict students' learning performance during an embodied activity. We present an in-situ study where 110 primary school students (aged 8–9 years), solved a tangible learning activity for learning human body anatomy. During the experiment, students' learning experience was monitored by collecting their eye-tracking data, learning profiles, academic performances, and time to complete the activity. We applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between eye-gaze features and students' learning performance. The obtained results suggest that combining eye-gaze tracking with learning traces and behaviour attributes may support an accurate prediction of students' learning performance. This research sheds light on the opportunities offered in the intersection of eye-gaze tracking with learning traces, and its possible contribution to investigating students' behaviour within an embodied learning context.

The main challenge of this task is how to decide which past problems are relevant for predicting performance on a future problem. This paper proposes a set of weighting schemes to address this challenge. Specifically, students' behaviors and performance on past problems were weighted in predicting performance on future problems. The weight of a past problem was proportional to its similarity with the future problem. Problem similarity was quantified in terms of source code, problem prompts, and struggling patterns. In addition, we considered another weighting scheme where past problems were weighted by the order in which students attempted them. Prior studies have used problem similarity and order information in learner modeling, but the proposed weighting schemes are more flexible in capturing problem similarity on various problem properties and weighting various behaviors and performance information on past problems. We systematically investigate the utility of the weighting schemes on performance prediction through two analyses. The first analysis found that the weighting schemes based on source code similarity, struggling pattern similarity, and problem order improved the prediction performance, but the weighting scheme based on problem prompts did not. The second analysis found that the weighting scheme allows a simple and interpretable model, such as logistic regression, to have performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep-learning models. We discussed the implications of the weighting schemes for learner modeling and suggested directions for further improvement.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1383391&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

The establishment and practices associated with adjustment rooms are a local example of broader international trends related to the classification and streaming of schoolchildren. In this study, I argue that the function of classification and the structure of normalisation were embedded in the practices of adjustment rooms. Since a diverse group of children were being placed in ungraded rooms in Los Angeles and were not being properly educated, the adjustment room practice was initiated by identifying educable children from among them. New educational methods, which were gaining attention in progressive education at the time, were thus developed to compensate for educational delays. The goal of the adjustment rooms, which were designed to educate ""backward"" and ""misfit"" children, was to provide auxiliary education and return them to regular classes in a short period of time. Thus, on the one hand, the adjustment room had the function of promoting normalisation to the standard student model. On the other hand, the adjustment room functioned as a ""clearing house"" to categorise children, deciding their fate according to ambiguous criteria of educational potential. While attempts were made to return educable backward and misfit children to regular classes, ""feeble-minded"" children were judged to be uneducable and were removed from the adjustment room cycle, thereby promoting internal exclusion within schools.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1378558&site=ehost-live&scope=site"
"Could the Technology for Adaptive Learning Systems Come out of GBL?","Moffat, David; Shabalina, Olga; Khairov, Aleksander","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games Based Learning",="20490992",,="2023",,,"418","8","173734458",,"Academic Conferences International","Article","School children; Artificial intelligence; Educational games; Design students; Digital technology","Domain model; GBL; ITS; Learner model; Teaching GBL","Games based learning (GBL) has a related field that it can draw upon: intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). A common concern in both fields is adaptivity, whereby the system can automatically adapt to the user. In order to support this adaptation, an ITS will generally include a user model and may also have a formal domain model. Work in this area started optimistically some years ago, but seems to have either lost some of that initial enthusiasm or been diverted into other directions. We scan recent ITS literature to help consider why this might be, and suggest how GBL may be the field best placed to take the work forward again. Learner models have long been seen as useful for adaptive learning systems. They include information about the learner which allows the system to adapt the course of learning materials and exercises to the learner's particular characteristics. In order to achieve a good quality of adaptation to the user, a detailed model of the required domain knowledge is typically added. The user and domain models then have to be brought together to lay out a course of exercises for the learner to do, and to track progress as the knowledge is learned. It's an attractive research programme, but recent work has moved to new issues, such as MOOCs. The reasons for that are partly opportunistic and economical, but also suggest a deeper problem with the research programme. It is a costly task to develop a domain model, and a suitable learner model that can take advantage of it. We suggest that GBL is in a good position to push through this cost barrier, because much of the effort is already implicitly involved in the game design process, which typically has to be more rigorously planned out in order to make the game a good one. One might thus expect the next breakthroughs in adaptive learning systems to come from GBL. We further argue that the advantages to research, offered by the ITS framework, are also potentially beneficial to the way we teach the subject of GBL to our students on game development courses.

Recent research has revealed the importance of drawings, talk, and gestures in students' model-based reasoning. This study provides further insight into the complementary role of these multimodal representations in student' model-based reasoning. The empirical basis constitutes sequences of students' interactive modeling during a laboratory exercise targeted toward the molecular mechanism behind diagnostic tests. The analytical procedure involves a social-semiotic analysis of students' drawings and microanalyses of the sequences of student interaction while engaging with this modeling activity. Our findings reveal a pattern in the use of these representations and provide insights into their roles in students' model-based reasoning. During three critical episodes in the students' modeling process, we show how drawings, deictic gestures, talk, and iconic gestures in a recurring pattern contributed to bringing students' meaning-making forward: drawings contributed to opening a creative space for their reasoning, while explorative talk together with iconic gestures became an important resource in exploring the aspects that were not shown in the drawing. We also show how the different representations took on different semiotic loads depending on where in the modeling cycle they were. We show how certain semiotic choices in the first drawing seem to support the students' model-based reasoning. Representing gestures became particularly important when the students revised and extended their models. These findings are discussed in relation to the different affordances of the various modes of representation.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1358280&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

However, existing methods, such as deep knowledge tracing and dynamic key-value memory networks (DKVMN), fail to comprehensively consider some key features that may influence the prediction results of knowledge tracing. To solve this problem, we propose a new model called knowledge tracing based on multi-feature fusion (KTMFF), which introduces features of the question text, the knowledge point difficulty, the student ability, and the duration time, etc., provides feature extraction methods, and uses a multi-head self-attention mechanism to combine the above features. This model predicts student mastery levels of knowledge points more accurately. Experiments show that the area under curve (AUC) of the KTMFF model is 3.06% higher than that of the DKVMN model. Furthermore, the ablation study indicates that each of the above features can improve the AUC of the model.

Due to the different knowledge level of students and the large scale of exercise banks, it is difficult for general recommenders to recommend suitable exercises for each student, which decreases their learning efficiency. In this paper, we develop a 2-layer multi-objective framework for exercise recommendation with self-attention networks, abbreviated as MulOER-SAN, to capture the change in students' knowledge acquisition and thus provide customized exercise recommendations. Note that MulOER-SAN is a 2-layer framework. Via the bottom layer, a self-attention mechanism is adopted to predict the coverage in the next exercise, which can lead the learning process in the right direction. Moreover, we implement a novel knowledge tracing model with an enhanced self-attention sub-layer, thus tracing students' dynamic knowledge state evolution. As the top layer of the 2-layer model, exercises are filtered according to the bottom layer's predicted results, and the candidate subsets with appropriate difficulty and novelty are generated. From the perspective of diversity, we also carefully develop a chaotic sparrow search algorithm to further filter the candidate subset to avoid redundancy of recommended results. On the above basis, a simple yet effective difficulty smoothness factor is implemented to generate a high-quality ranking list in a real teaching application scenario. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets have demonstrated that the proposed MulOER-SAN framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of various evaluation metrics.

The KT task aims to model students' knowledge state in real-time according to their historical learning behavior, so as to predict their future learning performance. Online education has become more critical in recent years due to the impact of COVID-19, and KT has also attracted much attention due to its importance in the education field. However, previous KT models generally have the following three problems. Firstly, students' learning and forgetting behaviors affect their knowledge state, and past KT models have yet to exploit this fully. Secondly, the input of traditional KT models is mainly limited to students' exercise sequence and answers. In the learning process, students' answering performance can reflect their knowledge level. Finally, the context of students' learning sequence also affects their judgment of the knowledge state. In this paper, we combined educational psychology theories to propose enhanced learning and forgetting behavior for contextual knowledge tracing (LFEKT). LFEKT enriches the features of exercises by introducing difficulty information and considers the influence of students' answering behavior on the knowledge state. In order to model students' learning and forgetting behavior, LFEKT integrates multiple influencing factors to build a knowledge acquisition module and a knowledge retention module. Furthermore, LFEKT introduces a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the contextual relations of learned sequences. From the experimental results, it can be seen that LFEKT had better prediction performance than existing models on four public datasets, which indicates that LFEKT can better trace students' knowledge state and has better prediction performance.

Intelligent textbooks extend regular textbooks by integrating machine-manipulable knowledge, and the most popular type of integrated knowledge is a list of relevant concepts mentioned in the textbooks. With these concepts, multiple intelligent operations, such as content linking, content recommendation, or student modeling, can be performed. However, existing automatic keyphrase extraction methods, even supervised ones, cannot deliver sufficient accuracy to be practically useful in this task. Manual annotation by experts has been demonstrated to be a preferred approach for producing high-quality labeled data for training supervised models. However, most researchers in the education domain still consider the concept annotation process as an ad-hoc activity rather than a carefully executed task, which can result in low-quality annotated data. Using the annotation of concepts for the Introduction to Information Retrieval textbook as a case study, this paper presents a knowledge engineering method to obtain reliable concept annotations. As demonstrated by the data we collected, the inter-annotator agreement gradually increased along with our procedure, and the concept annotations we produced led to better results in document linking and student modeling tasks. The contributions of our work include a validated knowledge engineering procedure, a codebook for technical concept annotation, and a set of concept annotations for the target textbook, which could be used as a gold standard in further intelligent textbook research.

"INCORPORATING PARTIAL STUDENT SELF-GRADING MODEL IN THE REMOTE LEARNING SYSTEM (POST COVID-19) .","Kong, Eugene H.","Journal of Educators Online",="1547500X",,="2023 Special Issue","20","2","96","6","163747267",,"Journal of Educators Online","Article","Student cheating; Distance education; Instructional systems; Student engagement; Online education; Academic motivation; COVID-19","Motivation; Remote Learning; Self-grading","Letter grading systems in education have been widely accepted as a strong medium to assess the educational performance of students across the world. It has been a successful system for many years because it can motivate students to achieve satisfactory grades in a course. However, recent studies indicate that grades can also foster anxiety and demotivate students to learn. This fact can be challenging because many investigators claim that motivation and student engagement are key to student success, especially in online education. This situation is even more problematic with the recent outbreak of COVID-19. There has been a major shift in the education sector from face-to- face instruction to online instruction. To mitigate the negative effects of the grading system, incorporating a partial student self-grading model in remote learning is proposed. The partial self- grading student model can potentially increase motivation, positive attitude and decrease the temptation to cheat on assignments. Another benefit of this system is that it can create a platform where students and instructors can discuss the grades given, thus creating a two-way learning system instead of a one-way learning system. The powerful impacts and benefits of the partial student self-grading model in online education are explored and discussed.

A key component of the online education system, knowledge tracing (KT) assesses the state of knowledge by tracing each learner's learning activities. The deep KT model, however, is unable to completely extract the features of the questions and skills due to the heterogeneity of the knowledge structure and the sparsity of the interaction records. The model's capacity to handle diverse data is also restricted by over parameterization. Additionally, rather than focusing solely on a precise fit, Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) should stress interpretable feedback to the learner. The deep KT approach's item parameters are still unable to give students useful feedback. This paper proposes to trace learner's short-term attentional knowledge based on heterogeneous hierarchical differentiation, named HHSKT. Hierarchical heterogeneous knowledge structures and short-term memory enhancement will be used to model the effects of different interaction sequences on learners. Specifically, knowledge structure features are extracted by constructing a heterogeneous graph-based graph information augmentation component. Question differentiation parameters are derived by transforming the TrueSkill system. Besides, learners' history-related practices are emphasized by windowing attention. Comparing regression-based and deep-based knowledge tracing experiments shows that HHSKT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach on three real-world benchmark datasets (with an average AUC improvement of up to 3%), demonstrating the superiority of the proposed model. • This research developed a heterogeneous GNN-based knowledge tracing model. • The model can obtain hierarchical heterogeneous knowledge states. • The model transforms the TrueSkill system to obtain interpretable parameters. • The model's window attention outperforms original mechanism. • The model outperforms graph-based knowledge tracing models.

Specifically, the first layer fits the influence of exercises on concepts, the second layer fits the interaction between concepts, and the third layer fits the influence of concepts on exercises. The three layers allow ICD to effectively distinguish learners with different cognitive levels, that is, ICD has good interpretability. The experimental results show that both the performance and interpretability of ICD are better than those of the latest state-of-the-art CDMs such as RCD, NCDM, and CDGK, and classical CDMs such as DINA and MIRT. • Learner modeling for personalized learning in Intelligent Tutor System. • Novel neural network mine quantitative relation between exercises and concepts. • New cognitive diagnosis model can fully utilize interaction among concepts. • Bias is replaced by slip and guess to fit learners' unexpected behavior. • Proposed degree of distinguishing to evaluate cognitive model's interpretability.

One of the possible uses of games in education is as game-based assessments (GBA), using game tasks to generate evidence about skills and content knowledge that can be valuable. There are different approaches in the literature to implement the assessment machinery of these GBA, all of them having strengths and drawbacks. In this article, we propose using multivariate Elo-based learner modeling, as we believe it has a strong potential in the context of GBA for three aims: first, to simultaneously measure students competence across several knowledge components in a game; second, to predict task performance; and finally, to estimate task difficulty within the game. To do so, we present our GBA Shadowspect, which is focused on solving geometry puzzles, and we depict our implementation using data collected from several high schools across the USA. We obtain high-performing results (AUC of 0.87) and demonstrate that the model enables analysis of how each student's competency evolves after each puzzle attempt. Moreover, the model provides accurate estimations of each task's difficulty, enabling iterative improvement of the game design. This study highlights the potential that multivariate Elo-based learner modeling has within the context of GBA, sharing lessons learned, and encouraging future researchers in the field to consider this algorithm to build their assessment machinery.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1374066&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

This joint extraction method can extract both course knowledge entities and their relationships from the unstructured text of online courses, thus alleviating the problem of error propagation. On the other hand, since some parameters in the joint model can be shared by the entity identification task and the relationship classification task, this helps the model to capture the interaction between the two subtasks. Similar courses are judged based on the extracted course knowledge points, while course knowledge chains are generated based on the relationships between course knowledge points. In terms of user learning behavior, by analyzing user online learning behavior data, this paper uses five variables, namely the number of learning hours, the number of discussions, the number of visits, the number of task points completed, and the number of learning courses, to judge and cluster user similarity using an information entropy-based learner behavior weight assignment method. Based on the course knowledge map, this paper firstly constructs a learner model with four dimensions of basic learner profile, cognitive level, learning style, and historical learning records. Secondly, it predicts the target knowledge points of learners based on their learning data using the Armorial algorithm and maps them in the knowledge map, then uses natural language processing related techniques to find the conceptual similarity between knowledge points and proposes a deep recommendation strategy based on the knowledge graph correlations. At the same time, the recommended courses based on learners' behavioral data are more relevant and accurate, which greatly improves learners' efficiency and satisfaction in the learning process.

"Multi-dimensional potential factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine booster acceptance and hesitancy among university academic community in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional comparative study.","Roy DN; Azam MS; Islam E","PloS one",="1932-6203",,="2023 Apr 13","18","4","e0281395",,"37053270","10.1371/journal.pone.0281395","Public Library of Science","Journal Article","Bangladesh; COVID-19 epidemiology; COVID-19 prevention & control; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Universities; Bangladesh; Vaccination",,"Background and Aims: Vaccination is the most powerful public health intervention proven to be safe and effective in the battle against the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite the potential therapeutic benefits of primer vaccine dosage regimens, public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine booster dose (VBD) acceptance and hesitancy vary among various sub-group populations. This study investigates COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance and compares the multi-dimensional potential factors influencing VBD acceptance and hesitancy among university teachers and the student community in Bangladesh. Methods: This web-based cross-sectional study employed an anonymous, validated, and self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire items were adopted from a theoretical analysis of the recent relevant literature. The questionnaire was deployed in an on-line-enabled format (Google form) and conveniently distributed to 685 teachers and 990 students between 15th June, 2022 and 15th August, 2022 which resulted in the participation of 1250 (505 teachers vs.745 students) total respondents (response rate 73.72% vs. 75.25%) from various universities in Bangladesh. A non-parametric analytical tool (binary logistic regression) was applied to rationalize the study objectives and a Chi-squared test was performed to estimate the booster- hesitant risky group. Results: The pooled COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance rates were 84.6% (95% CI 81.5─87.7) and 67.2% (95% CI 63.8─70.6) for teachers and students in the university academic community, respectively. In employing a binary logistic regression, this study revealed that out of twelve (12)multi-dimensional key predictors, ""equal safety"", ""risk-benefit ratio"", and ""variant control"" had a significant positive association with VBD acceptance in both sets (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, and p = 0.005, respectively). Varied effects were found for several predictors; post-vaccination ""side effects"" had a significant negative association (p = 0.020) and ""community protection"" had significant positive association (p = 0.034) with vaccine booster dose acceptance in the teachers community while these variables were insignificant in the students cohort. ""Trust"" had a highly significant positive association (p = 0.000);""communication"" and ""academic attainment"" had significant positive associations (p = 0.033 and 0.024, respectively) with VBD acceptance in the students cohort, while these predictors were insignificant in the teachers community. Women were more likely to receive a third dose of the vaccine (OR = 1.4 vs. 0.9 between teacher and student model); however, no significant association between gender and booster vaccine acceptance was found in a comparative Chi-squared model. Therefore, statistically, the booster vaccine-hesitant risky group was not found to implicate the massive booster vaccine drive among the university academic community. Conclusions: COVID-19 booster vaccine acceptability among the student cohort was slightly lower than pre-roll-out intent. The teacher community was more inclined to get booster vaccinated. Moreover, differences were found between the multi-dimensional potential factors associated with VBD acceptance among teachers and students in university settings. This study explicitly confirmed positive attitudes toward the safety, health benefits, and variants control of the COVID-19 VBD under any circumstances. Post-vaccination side effect concern was found to be a barrier to administering booster shots and a reason for booster skepticism. Tailored communication and health education interventions need to be adopted to improve the public awareness of booster vaccine consequences, and limit booster skepticism.

Ways to address placement shortages have been the focus of international scholarship for decades, with a particular emphasis on models of supervision and the ratio of students to educator. Review articles, however, conclude that there is a lack of clarity on what constitutes a model or approach and inconsistent use of terminology. The aim of this scoping review was to identify, organise and synthesise existing evidence in relation to the supervision of allied health students whilst on practice placement to provide a clearer focus for future research and to support practice placement provider decision making. Methods: Five databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 onwards. Data were extracted and analysed according to approaches to supervision and student and/or educator outcomes for different models used. Each outcome was aligned to modified Kirkpatrick levels of evaluation. Results: 44 articles were reviewed. The terms models and approaches were poorly defined and often used interchangeably. Studies varied in the methods employed and were typically of low to moderate methodological quality with a dominance of Kirkpatrick Level 2a outcomes reported. Conclusion: This review identified some positive qualitative outcomes for both students and educators for shared supervision models despite the allegiance allied health holds to the single student model. Further rigorous investigation into the use of shared supervision in allied health through collecting data on indicators beyond perception, such as time use, cost, productivity and patient outcomes, is warranted.

Given the popularity of ontology/knowledge-based systems in adaptive learning, this work reviews learning path in ontology-based recommender systems. The review covers recommendation trends, ontology use, recommendation process, recommendation technique, contributing factors, and recommender evaluations. A total of 12,972 articles published between 2010 and 2020 were identified in the initial search across five major databases, and 9 of them are considered in this work. Currently, student model, learning objects, learning activities, and external environment are contributing factors for recommending learning object sequence. We also found that the current trend for LP recommendations process is semi-dynamic and dynamic. Semi-dynamic learning path are started by a pre-set path, while dynamic learning path is flexible from the first step and intended for personal use. The recommendation process itself has four phases: predelivery of the first learning object, current learning object delivery, learning object postdelivery, and predelivery of the next learning object. The current recommendation technique collaborates ontology and several techniques, such as Bayesian networks, data mining, and other artificial intelligence technique. To evaluate performance, learning path recommender systems use real students, control groups in parallel or sequential experiments, and student satisfaction surveys. Ontology could work with knowledge representation instruments, educational psychology, and evolutionary computation to create a future dynamic learning path in adaptive learning environment.

One key reason for this is that contemporary knowledge tracing algorithms primarily infer next-problem correctness in the learning system, but do not attempt to infer the knowledge the student can carry out of the system, information more useful for teachers. The ability of knowledge tracing algorithms to predict problem correctness using data from intelligent tutoring systems has been extensively researched, but data from outcomes other than next-problem correctness have received less attention. In addition, there has been limited use of knowledge tracing algorithms in games, because algorithms that do attempt to infer knowledge from answer correctness are often too simple to capture the more complex evidence of learning within games. In this study, data from a digital learning game, (anonymized), was used to compare ten knowledge tracing algorithms' ability to predict students' knowledge carried outside the learning system–measured here by posttest scores–given their game activity. All Opportunities Averaged (AOA), a method proposed by Authors (2020) was used to convert correctness predictions to knowledge estimates, which were also compared to the built-in estimates from algorithms that produced them. Although statistical testing was not feasible for these data, three algorithms tended to perform better than the others: Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks, Logistic Knowledge Tracing, and a multivariate version of Elo. Algorithms' built-in estimates of student ability underperformed estimates produced by AOA, suggesting that some algorithms may be better at estimating performance than ability. Theoretical and methodological challenges related to comparing knowledge estimates with hypothesis testing are also discussed.

Knowledge tracing is one of the most popular technologies for this purpose, and deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Compared to classical models, such as Bayesian knowledge tracing, which track students' knowledge proficiencies, deep learning-based knowledge tracing is usually modeled to predict students' performances on questions, while ignoring the interpretability of students' knowledge states. However, for many practical applications, such as learning resource recommendation, it would be more helpful if we could explicitly track students' abilities or knowledge proficiencies separately from performance prediction. Researchers in psychometric area already designed cognitive diagnosis solutions to quantify the knowledge states of students in static conditions (e.g., examination), where the educational priors (i.e., factors related to students' learning process) were proved beneficial for student modeling. Inspired by this, we propose dynamic cognitive diagnosis, which integrates the interpretability of educational priors from cognitive diagnosis into deep learning-based knowledge tracing methods. We first discuss and provide evidence of which educational priors can be integrated, including question attributes and interaction function. Then we show the effects of using the educational priors in deep learning-based knowledge tracing from two aspects, i.e., interpretability and accuracy. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we prove that properly chosen priors can enable deep learning-based methods to evaluate students' knowledge states in a manner that is consistent with domain knowledge or human experience. Moreover, educational priors also improve the accuracy of student performance prediction.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1381251&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

However, there are two crucial issues in deep learning-based KT models. First, the knowledge concepts are used to predict learners' performance instead of exercises. This choice ignores the actual difference among exercises, which leads to the KT model's inability to explore the rich information at the exercise level, thus, weakening the KT model's performance. Second, the actual difference in prior knowledge is neglected. Therefore, in-depth research of these two types of the actual differences offers the possibility to improve the prediction performance of KT further. To this end, we propose a fine-grained knowledge tracing model (FGKT) to capture these two types of actual differences. We first obtain the exercise representations by considering the corresponding knowledge concepts and actual difference among exercises. Then, an effective attention mechanism is designed to capture the relevance between assessment exercises and historical interactions to acquire individual prior knowledge. Finally, we evaluate the proposed FGKT model on several available benchmark datasets. The experiment results show that our model surpasses benchmark KT models by up to 7% in prediction performance on the latest ASSISTments dataset.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1381272&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

Learning management systems (LMSs) are important components in SPOCs. They can collect various data related to student behavior and support pedagogical interventions. This research used feature engineering and nearest neighbor smoothing models to predict the performance of students. Five learning behavior features were selected based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with students' final grades. Through testing with data from the fall semester of 2020, the model attained the highest ROC-AUC value of 0.9390. Based on these models, the researchers conducted an engagement intervention that displayed learning behavior dashboards to students in the fall of 2021. During the intervention, the course platform updated the dashboards and notified students weekly. This intervention was further investigated through a randomized controlled trial. The experimental results suggested that the intervention could improve students' learning behavior in terms of total study time, tutorial reading, and video viewing. In addition, this study used a modified dynamic key-value memory network model to depict a student's knowledge state and to calculate the probability of solving an exercise by mining numerous exercise records. Based on the predicted probability, instructors could recommend personalized exercises for each student. In the fall of 2021, the researchers also conducted a randomized controlled trial on this intervention, demonstrating that this personalized exercise recommendation could increase students' concept mastery. Experiments revealed that the proposed models and interventions had a positive effect on students' learning of course content.","https://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1381264&site=ehost-live&scope=site"

While many pre-college students use system modeling tools, there is limited evidence of student reasoning about causal relationships that interact in diverging and converging chains, and how these affect system behavior. A chemistry unit on gas phenomena was implemented in two successive years with 73 high school students. Although the phenomena could be explained with simple linear causal reasoning, many student models included surprising and problematic causal chains and non-linear patterns. Commonly, discussion about student models in classrooms and interviews focuses on individual causal relationships. However, in our experience, this can fail to bring to the surface conceptual issues that result from the combination of two or more relationships. Using interview data from 19 students, we looked for instances where students explained their conceptions and we identified questioning strategies that elicited these explanations. Questions that appeared most productive asked about distal relationships between nonadjacent variables in model substructures of three to four variables. In response to these questions, eight students expressed their thinking about relationship combinations, including unexpected reasoning that had not emerged during classroom instruction. Using exemplars from three interviews, we argue that students engage in complex causal reasoning that may be implicit and unexpected, and that if this is not recognized, it cannot be responded to during instruction.

The RNN-FitNets replaces the teacher model in KD with ""an RNN model with a long-term time-series in which the features during the entire course are inputted"" and the student model in KD with ""an RNN model with a short-term time-series in which only the features during the early stages are inputted."" As a result, the RNN model in the early stage was trained to output the same results as the more accurate RNN model in the later stages. The experiment compared RNN-FitNets with a normal RNN model on a dataset of 296 university students in total. The results showed that RNN-FitNets can improve early prediction. Moreover, the SHAP value was employed to explain the contribution of the input features to the prediction results by RNN-FitNets.

The behavioral features exhibited during students' learning process bear information that impacts the state of a student's knowledge mastery. To study the influence of learning behaviors on students' knowledge mastery state in the learning process, we propose a Precise Modeling of Learning Process based on Multiple Behavioral Features for Knowledge Tracing model (MBFKT), which models a student's learning process by making use of these behavioral features. MBFKT initially processes these features through multi-head attention networks, memory networks, and recurrent neural networks to model students' learning process into three memory links: memory decline link, memory enhancement link, and memory update link. Various update strategies are designed for each memory link, and the performance of numerous possible combinations of behavioral features in the memory links is compared, for the rules of learning and forgetting to be explained. Furthermore, we also study the contribution and degree of influence of different behavioral features on a student's knowledge mastery state, by which MBFKT is improved, thus enhancing the accuracy of prediction. Through experiments on real online education datasets and comparison with existing benchmark methods, it is observed that MBFKT has evident advantages in predicting performance with good interpretability.

Nonetheless, online learning is still facing various challenges. The challenges include lack of support and loneliness experienced by learners. Adaptive online learning is one of the means that researchers are proposing to support learners and reduce the loneliness they experience in online learning. Research in adaptive online learning has been on the rise. Though there are several review studies that have attempted to provide summaries of research and development happening in this area, there is still lack of a comprehensive and up-to-date review that looks at the aspects of adaptive online learning systems in terms of the learner characteristics being modelled, domain model, adaptation model, the various techniques used to achieve the various tasks in those models and the impact the adaptive online learning has on learning. This study therefore was initiated in order to fill this gap. The study was carried out using a systematic literature review methodology. A total of 59 articles were used in the study, drawn from six databases namely Science direct, IEEE explore, ACM, Emerald, Springer and Taylor and Francis. The results indicate that: the most used learner characteristic is learning style even though the use of learning knowledge is on the rise; there is a rise in the use of machine learning algorithms in learner modelling; learning content is the most common target for adaptation; rules is the most utilized method in the adaptation model; and most adaptive online learning have not been evaluated in terms of learning. There is therefore a need for evaluation of the developed adaptive online learning and more studies that utilize more than one learner characteristic as the basis for adaptation and those that use machine learning.

Systems thinking (ST) is a promising approach for developing solutions to various problems that society faces and has been acknowledged as a crosscutting concept that should be integrated across educational science disciplines. However, studies show that engaging students in ST is challenging, especially concerning aspects like change over time and feedback. Using computational system models and a system dynamics approach can support students in overcoming these challenges when making sense of complex phenomena. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that examines how 10th grade students engage in aspects of ST through computational system modeling as part of a Next Generation Science Standards-aligned project-based learning unit on chemical kinetics. We show students' increased capacity to explain the underlying mechanism of the phenomenon in terms of change over time that goes beyond linear causal relationships. However, student models and their accompanying explanations were limited in scope as students did not address feedback mechanisms as part of their modeling and explanations. In addition, we describe specific challenges students encountered when evaluating and revising models. In particular, we show epistemological barriers to fruitful use of real-world data for model revision. Our findings provide insights into the opportunities of a system dynamics approach and the challenges that remain in supporting students to make sense of complex phenomena and nonlinear mechanisms.

This is achieved by exploring and analyzing the common architectural attributes among personalized learning software systems. A literature-driven taxonomy is recognized and built to categorize and analyze the reviewed literature. Relevant papers are filtered to produce a final set of full systems to be reviewed and analyzed. In this meta-review, a set of 72 selected personalized learning software systems have been reviewed and categorized based on the proposed personalized learning taxonomy. The proposed taxonomy outlines the three main architectural components of any personalized learning software system: learning environment, learner model, and content. It further defines the different realizations and attributions of each component. Surveyed systems have been analyzed under the proposed taxonomy according to their architectural components, usage, strengths, and weaknesses. Then, the role of these systems in the development of the field of personalized learning systems is discussed.

To mimic how the teacher teaches the student, existing knowledge distillation methods mainly adapt an unidirectional knowledge transfer, where the knowledge extracted from different intermedicate layers of the teacher model is used to guide the student model. However, it turns out that the students can learn more effectively through multi-stage learning with a self-reflection in the real-world education scenario, which is nevertheless ignored by current knowledge distillation methods. Inspired by this, we devise a new knowledge distillation framework entitled multi-target knowledge distillation via student self-reflection or MTKD-SSR, which can not only enhance the teacher's ability in unfolding the knowledge to be distilled, but also improve the student's capacity of digesting the knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three target knowledge distillation mechanisms: a stage-wise channel distillation (SCD), a stage-wise response distillation (SRD), and a cross-stage review distillation (CRD), where SCD and SRD transfer feature-based knowledge (i.e., channel features) and response-based knowledge (i.e., logits) at different stages, respectively; and CRD encourages the student model to conduct self-reflective learning after each stage by a self-distillation of the response-based knowledge. Experimental results on five popular visual recognition datasets, CIFAR-100, Market-1501, CUB200-2011, ImageNet, and Pascal VOC, demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods.

Understanding factors that influence group performance in PBCL, such as gender composition, is crucial.This study investigates the impact of gender composition on group performance in PBCL, specifically focusing on the critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration (4Cs) 21st‐century learning skills.A total of 312 students were divided into distinct Python programming groups for the experiment. Group performance was assessed using an agglomerative clustering algorithm guided by the ontological group learner model, which examined gender composition, communication patterns, collaboration strategies and project assessment outcomes.Gender‐balanced groups demonstrated positive outcomes in the 4Cs skills, with groups containing a greater proportion of women exhibiting superior performance in collaboration and communication, whereas majority‐male groups performed relatively poorer across all skills. Notably, in the context of PBCL, the presence of more women in small groups enhanced the 4Cs skills project assessment outcomes.Future research should focus on providing effective support for male online learners in developing the 4Cs skills. The findings offer insights and recommendations for group formation in collaborative learning, facilitating the design of inclusive and impactful learning environments.

Based on this learner model, ALTs adjust the difficulty of problems for each child, yet children still need to regulate their practice behaviour and uphold effort and accuracy. The temporal trajectories are consequently likely to, besides showing children's knowledge development, be indicative of children's regulation. Therefore, we explore clusters of these trajectories to further identify failure in children's self-regulated learning (SRL) and potential support needs. We propose a data-driven approach to cluster 354 trajectories of 134 5th graders learning three skills with different complexity. The resulting 9 clusters were interpreted using practice accuracy and effort as indicators of regulation of practice behaviour and prior and post-knowledge and learning gain as indicators of knowledge development. The differences between clusters regarding these indicators signal there are different levels of SRL failure and, consequently, different SRL support needs: high accuracy and knowledge development indicate minimal support needs, whereas clusters with low accuracy, showing no knowledge development, indicate extensive SRL support needs. In conclusion: clusters of temporal patterns in children's learning data can identify SRL support is needed. • Nine distinct clusters of learning behaviour were distilled with a data-driven approach. • The clusters differed significantly on learning metrics. • The clusters provide insight into cognitive knowledge and self-regulated learning.

However, the individualization of questions is neglected and difficulty level differ from question to question, which would give some valuable clues to KT. Towards this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Multiple Question Factors for Knowledge Tracing (MQFKT) method, which fully exploits various question factors to generate better prediction. On one hand, calibrated student-concept connection space is established to obtain fine-grained response representations on questions according to the information of responses on questions.

However, the existing resource recommendation methods have two problems. On the one hand, they do not make full use of the implicit interaction data of learners in the learning process, i.e., they rarely reflect the comprehensive consideration of learners' interest preferences and cognitive level when describing learners. On the other hand, they are mostly based on collaborative filtering algorithms, using the similarity between learners or videos to recommend, ignoring the impact of semantic relations between videos on the recommendation results. In view of this, we proposed a personalized learning video matching method (IFT‐PTransE) based on heterogeneous feature data transfer and knowledge reasoning from two aspects of learning behavior data mining and knowledge graph representation learning. In this method, firstly, a learner model is constructed. By analyzing and quantifying various implicit interaction behavior data of learners, the sparse video scoring matrix is filled as auxiliary data to complete the transfer of target scoring data. Secondly, the semantic close relationship between videos is introduced. PTransE algorithm is used to mine the multi‐path relationship between entities. All entity relationships are embedded into the low dimensional vector space, so that the semantic similarity between videos can be calculated using the distance between vectors. Finally, video score similarity and semantic similarity between frequencies are fused. video sorting is performed based on the improved collaborative filtering algorithm and then recommend the top N videos to the students. Through simulation and analysis, the effectiveness of this method in personalized video matching is proved. This method makes up for the shortcomings of collaborative filtering algorithm in using implicit information, enhances the recommendation effect at the semantic level, and solves the data sparse and cold start problems to a certain extent. © 2023 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

As a major task of ITS, Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to capture a student's dynamic knowledge state based on his historical response sequences and provide personalized learning assistance to him. However, most existing KT methods have encountered the data sparsity problem. In real scenarios, an online tutoring system usually has an extensive collection of questions while each student can only interact with a limited number of questions. As a result, the records of some questions could be extremely sparse, which degrades the performance of traditional KT models. To resolve this issue, we propose a D ual-channel H eterogeneous G raph N etwork (DHGN) to learn informative representations of questions from students' records by capturing both the high-order heterogeneous and local relations. As the supervised learning manner applied in previous methods is incapable of exploiting unobserved relations between questions, we innovatively integrate a self-supervised framework into the KT task and employ contrastive learning via the two channels of DHGN, supplementing as an auxiliary task to improve the KT performance. Moreover, we adopt the attention mechanism, which has achieved impressive performance in natural language processing tasks, to effectively capture students' knowledge state. But the standard attention network is inapplicable to the KT task because the current knowledge state of a student usually shows strong dependency on his recently interactive questions, unlike the situation of language processing tasks, which focus more on the long-term dependency. To avoid the inefficiency of standard attention networks in the KT task, we further devise a novel H ybrid A ttentive N etwork (HAN), which produces both the global attention and the hierarchical local attention to model the long-term and short-term intents, respectively. Then, by the gating network, a student's long-term and short-term intents are combined for efficient prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant performance improvement compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed dual-channel heterogeneous graph framework and hybrid attentive network. • A dual-channel heterogeneous graph network for representation modeling. • Investigating the potentials of self-supervised learning for KT. • Adopting α -entmax transformation function in the proposed graph. • A novel hybrid attentive network for tracking students' state.

Predictions from learner models are frequently used in combination with mastery criterion decision rules to make pedagogical decisions. Important aspects of learner models, such as learning rate and item difficulty, can be estimated from prior data. A critical function of AIS is to have students practice new content once the AIS predicts that they have 'mastered' current content or learned it to some criterion. For making this prediction, individual student parameters (e.g., for learning rate) are frequently unavailable due to having no prior data about a student, and thus population-level parameters or rules-of-thumb are typically applied instead. In this paper, we will argue and demonstrate via simulation and data analysis that even in best-case scenarios, learner models assuming equal learning rates for students will inevitably lead to systematic errors that result in suboptimal pedagogical decisions for most learners. This finding leads us to conclude that systematic errors should be expected, and mechanisms to adjust predictions to account for them should be included in AIS. We introduce two solutions that can adjust for student differences ""online"" in a running system: one that tracks systemic errors of the learner model (not the student) and adjusts accordingly, and a student-level performance adaptive feature. We demonstrate these solutions' efficacy and practicality on six large educational datasets and show that these features improved model accuracy in all tested datasets.

The lack of interpretability has painfully impeded DLKT models' practical applications, as they require the user to trust in the model's output. To tackle such a critical issue for today's DLKT models, we present an interpreting method by leveraging explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) techniques. Specifically, the interpreting method focuses on understanding the DLKT model's predictions from the perspective of its sequential inputs. We conduct comprehensive evaluations to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed interpreting method at the skill-answer pair level. Moreover, the interpreting results also capture the skill-level semantic information, including the skill-specific difference, distance and inner relationships. This work is a solid step towards fully explainable and practical knowledge tracing models for intelligent education.

In the second section, we describe different variants of the standard BKT model based on item response theory (IRT). Next, we demonstrate the estimation of BKT with the pyBKT library in Python, outlining data pre-processing steps, parameter estimation, and model evaluation.

A wide range of curricular and instructional supports like those embodied in model-based learning (MBL) are necessary for teachers to engage students in the core epistemic commitments of the Next-Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The main purpose of this study is to inform theory about students' early attempts to engage in the complex kinds of sensemaking experiences inherent in the Framework for K-12 Science Education and the NGSS. Data for this study was collected from 74 10th grade students in a high school in the Northwest region of the New England state. An explanatory sequential mixed-method research design was used to examine students' learning outcomes, and to better understand these outcomes in connection to their experiences engaging in modeling in the MBL curriculum unit. The results indicated that students' model scores, the number of concepts in models, and the coherence and sophistication of models improved between their initial and final models. Additionally, the following patterns emerged related to ways in which students engaged in the practice of modeling: (1) students attempted to directly represent what they observed, (2) they struggled to pictorially express complex patterns or mechanisms, and (3) students experienced difficulties representing models from a diverse range of perspectives. The patterns identified across student models, as well as their reports of experiences related to the MBL unit implementation, provided insight into student experiences with models, while also providing meaningful implications for the refinement of the MBL curriculum unit investigated in this research specifically, while informing approaches MBL curricular units aimed at supporting NGSS implementation efforts more generally.

Presently, e-learning Recommender Systems rely on deep learning methods to recommend appropriate e-learning materials to the students based on their learner profiles. Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) can be leveraged to enrich the recommender system. Users posted reviews and rating data are vital in accurately directing the student to the appropriate e-learning resources based on posted comments by comparable learners. Innovative has been made in this work to propose a new e-learning recommendation system based on individualization and FSA. A new framework is proposed based on collaborative filtering models (CFMs) integrating with fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) for hybrid recommendation (CFISAR) for effective recommendations. CFMs attempt to capture the learner's latent factors based on their selections of interest to build the learner profile. FSA models are introduced to deliver e-content with the highest ranked ratings related to the learner’s area and interests based on the extracted learner model. Moreover, a new approach is proposed to update the system continuously and not keep it bound to certain items by adding new books, where the initial rating of these new books is predicted based on FSA models. CFISAR is explored utilizing six CFMs to generate the prediction matrix and derive the learner model, resulting in a low MSE of 0.699 for Asymmetric SVD. The system used multiplication word embeddings for stronger corpus representation that were trained on a dataset generated for an educational context, and leveraging the goodness of deep learning, which predicted an accuracy of 0.9264% for the Peephole algorithm, that performed better than other models.

Automated animal activity recognition (AAR) has advanced greatly through recent advances in sensing technologies and deep learning, and improved livestock management efficiency, animal health, and welfare monitoring. In practical automated AAR systems where animals need to be monitored over a long period, the sampling rate dramatically affects the energy consumption and battery life of sensing devices due to continuous data collection and transmission. Considering real-world benefits, existing works have often lowered the sampling rate to reduce energy costs. However, when the sampling rate falls below a threshold, the AAR performance degrades rapidly due to many relevant signals being missed. Therefore, this study proposed a novel method, dubbed teacher-to-student information recovery (T2S-IR), to improve the performance of AAR at low sampling rates. This approach effectively leverages the knowledge obtained from high-sampling-rate data, to assist in recovering the missing information in features extracted by the classification network trained on low-sampling-rate data. The workflow of the T2S-IR contains two main steps. (1) we utilize high-sampling-rate data for training teacher classification and reconstruction networks sequentially. (2) Then, we train a student classification network using low-sampling-rate data, while promoting its performance by exploiting the knowledge learned by trained teacher networks via two novel modules, namely the reconstruction-based information recovery (RIR) module and the correlation-distillation-based information recovery (CDIR) module. Specifically, the RIR module employs the pretrained teacher reconstruction network to enforce the student classification network to learn complete and descriptive features. The CDIR module enforces the feature maps of student network to mimic internal correlations within feature maps of pretrained teacher classification network along temporal and sensor axes directions. To validate our proposed T2S-IR, we conducted experiments on two public datasets acquired for horses and goats using triaxial accelerometers and gyroscopes with an initial sampling rate of 100 Hz. Data having low sampling rates were obtained by downsampling the original data at different frequencies (i.e., 50, 25, 12.5, 10, 5, and 2 Hz). The results demonstrated that our method remarkably boosted the classification network trained on low-sampling-rate data (e.g., percentage-point increments in the precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy of 3.33%, 3.58%, 3.45%, and 2.19%, respectively, for the 12.5-Hz horse data and 7.6%, 4.44%, 6.9%, and 0.79%, respectively, for the 5-Hz goat data) while outperforming existing knowledge distillation methods. The enhanced classification network can be directly applied in practical AAR tasks with low sampling rates, significantly beneficial for scenarios with constrained energy sources for wearable devices.

A particular direction is to model students' learning outcomes in the context of their learning experience, i.e., the various student, course, and pedagogical elements. It contributes to a better understanding of the learning process, a more accurate prediction of students' attainments on the learning outcomes, and improvements in the design of learning activities to maximize student learning. However, most of the existing work in this area relies on statistical analysis that makes assumptions about attribute independence or simple linear dependence, which may not accurately reflect real-life scenarios. In contrast, the study described in this paper adopted a neural network-based approach to investigate the impact of students' learning experience on different service-learning outcomes. A neural network with attention mechanisms was constructed to predict students' service-learning outcomes by modeling the contextual information from their various learning experiences. In-depth evaluation experiments on a large-scale dataset collected from more than 10,000 students showed that this proposed model achieved better accuracy on predicting service-learning outcomes. More importantly, it could capture the interdependence between different aspects of student learning experience and the learning outcomes. We believe that this framework can be extended to student modeling for other types of learning activities.

It has shown a high prediction accuracy against many other KT approaches. While, the desire to estimate more accurately the student level leads researchers to enhance PFA by inventing several advanced extensions. However, most of the proposed extensions have exclusively been improved in a pedagogical sense, as the improvements have mostly been limited to the analysis of students' behaviour during their learning process. In contrast, Machine Learning provides many powerful methods that could be efficient to enhance, in the technical sense, the prediction of student performance. Our goal is to focus on the exploitation of Ensemble Learning methods as an extremely effective Machine Learning paradigm used to create many advanced solutions in several fields. In this sense, we propose a new PFA approach based on different models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost) in order to increase the predictive accuracy of student performance.

Objective: The paper reviews the current research on intelligent learning technology designed to make models of student learning and instruction transparent to teachers, an area we call model‐based learning analytics. We intended to gain an insight into the coupling between the knowledge models that underpin the intelligent system and the knowledge used by teachers in their classroom decision making. Methods: Using a systematic literature review methodology, we first identified 42 papers, mainly from the domain of intelligent tutoring systems and learning analytics dashboards that conformed to our selection criteria. We then qualitatively analysed the context in which the systems were applied, models they used and benefits reported for teachers and learners. Results and Conclusions: A majority of papers used either domain or learner models, suggesting that instructional decisions are mostly left to teachers. Compared to previous reviews, our set of papers appeared to have a stronger focus on providing teachers with theory‐driven insights and instructional decisions. This suggests that model‐based learning analytics can address some of the shortcomings of the field, like meaningfulness and actionability of learning analytics tools. However, impact in the classroom still needs further research, as in half of the cases the reported benefits were not backed with evidence. Future research should focus on the dynamic interaction between teachers and technology and how learning analytics has an impact on learning and decision making by teachers and students. We offer a taxonomy of knowledge models that can serve as a starting point for designing such interaction.

A human teacher can track the knowledge of students to customize the teaching on students’ needs. With the rise of online education platforms, there is a similar need for machines to track the knowledge of students and tailor their learning experience. This is known as the Knowledge Tracing (KT) problem in the literature. Effectively solving the KT problem would unlock the potential of computer-aided education applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, curriculum learning, and learning materials’ recommendation. Moreover, from a more general viewpoint, a student may represent any kind of intelligent agents including both human and artificial agents. Thus, the potential of KT can be extended to any machine teaching application scenarios which seek for customizing the learning experience for a student agent (i.e., a machine learning model). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey for the KT literature. We cover a broad range of methods starting from the early attempts to the recent state-of-the-art methods using deep learning, while highlighting the theoretical aspects of models and the characteristics of benchmark datasets. Besides these, we shed light on key modelling differences between closely related methods and summarize them in an easy-to-understand format.

It is the most fundamental and challenging task in the system. Existing KT models have achieved promising results. However, considerable interactions between the student entity and the other two types of entities (i.e., questions and skills) in ITS have not been well utilized, which restricts the performance of these models. To this end, we propose HIN-KT, a novel heterogeneous information network (HIN)-based pre-processing model, to further enhance the performance of existing KT models. An HIN is first built to model student–question–skill interactions. Subsequently, HIN-KT employs the interaction information modeled by HIN to pre-train embeddings for questions and then adopts pre-trained question embeddings to enhance the performance of recent deep KT models. Experimental results over three public KT datasets demonstrate that large gains in knowledge tracing can be achieved when the proposed HIN-KT model is used to pre-train question embeddings for state-of-the-art deep KT models. In particular, the two state-of-the-art deep KT models, deep knowledge tracing (DKT) and convolutional knowledge tracing (CKT) successfully improved their performance by an average of 7.88% with the help of the HIN-KT model, which is significant progress made in the knowledge tracing domain.

An important research direction of the field is to provide students with customised learning trajectories via student modelling. Previous studies have shown that customisation of learning trajectories could effectively improve students' learning experiences and outcomes. However, training an ITS that can customise students' learning trajectories suffers from cold-start, time-consumption, human labour-intensity, and cost problems. One feasible approach is to simulate real students' behaviour trajectories through algorithms, to generate data that could be used to train the ITS. Nonetheless, implementing high-accuracy student modelling methods that effectively address these issues remains an ongoing challenge. Traditional simulation methods, in particular, encounter difficulties in ensuring the quality and diversity of the generated data, thereby limiting their capacity to provide intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) with high-fidelity and diverse training data. We thus propose Sim-GAIL, a novel student modelling method based on generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method using GAIL to address the challenge of lacking training data, resulting from the issues mentioned above. We analyse and compare the performance of Sim-GAIL with two traditional Reinforcement Learning-based and Imitation Learning-based methods using action distribution evaluation, cumulative reward evaluation, and offline-policy evaluation. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional ones on most metrics. Moreover, we apply our method to a domain plagued by the cold-start problem, knowledge tracing (KT), and the results show that our novel method could effectively improve the KT model's prediction accuracy in a cold-start scenario.

Correct predictions of student performance are prerequisites for ITS to supply intelligent services and optimize learning efficiency, e.g., recommending the most appropriate learning resources for each student. Existing methods mainly include cognitive diagnosis and knowledge tracing, both of which focus on students' cognitive modeling based on their interactions on a sequence of items and give predictions by assessing if their cognitive states can meet the item requirements. Specifically, cognitive diagnosis only considers students' global static cognitive states, while knowledge tracing focuses on students' local dynamics. However, both global and local features are critical for predicting student performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel G lobal and L ocal N eural C ognitive (GLNC) model to capture both global and local features in student-item interactions for more accurate predictions. Specifically, we first learn students' global cognitive level according to all student-item interactions. Then, we propose a self-attentive encoder based on the scaled dot-product attention mechanism to extract the local cognitive dynamics and the dependencies between students' recent interactions. Finally, to obtain better predictions, we design a fused gate based on the similarity between students' recently responded items and the item to be predicted to adaptively combine the global and local features. To evaluate the effectiveness of GLNC, we compare it with both cognitive diagnosis and knowledge tracing methods. All experiments are conducted on three public datasets that contain real student-item interactions on mathematics or language courses from various ITS. The experimental results demonstrate that GLNC achieves an average score of 0.7810 on the AUC metric, 0.7627 on the ACC metric, 0.3987 on the RMSE metric, 0.2023 on the r 2 metric, respectively achieving an average improvement of 1.84%, 1.07%, 1.87%, and 11.38% in contrast to existing state-of-the-art methods (i.e., NCD and LPKT). Moreover, we further analyze the performance of GLNC under different probabilities of guessing and slipping, the results indicate that GLNC is more robust against the influence of noisy data while considering both global and local features. Benefiting from the superior accuracy and stability, our proposed GLNC has a wide range of potential implications for ITS, which can be easily applied to improve students' learning efficiency and experience. • Cognitive diagnosis focuses on students' global static cognitive states. • Knowledge tracing measures students' local dynamics in learning. • It is critical to make trade-offs between global and local features. • Our method achieves more precise and robust results on performance prediction.

Knowledge tracing (KT) is a critical research topic in intelligent education and is a powerful tool for achieving AI-assisted education. Both the learning process and the response result are important for KT. However, existing KT methods rarely employ a stage-based modeling approach to dissect the learning process. We propose Progressive Knowledge Tracing (PKT), which models the learning process in stages. PKT decomposes the learning process into three relatively independent but progressively related stages: concept mastery, question solving, and answering behavior. Inspired by constructivist learning theory and item response theory, PKT incorporates interpretable parameters with educational significance. Compared with existing KT methods, this staged modeling method that integrates educational theory has more reasonable interpretability. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that PKT outperforms baseline methods. Several experiments show that PKT reasonably models the learning process. For example, it more reasonably estimates the trend of concept mastery over time, analyzes the reasons why learners make mistakes on specific questions, and provides estimates of question difficulty that are closer to reality. We also find the intuitive phenomenon that the difficulty of a question is positively correlated with the number of associated concepts. • Our model innovatively divides the learning process into three progressive stages. • Our model incorporates constructivist and item response theories. • Our model estimates question difficulty more reliably than baselines. • Our model outperforms baselines and interprets student learning status better. • Our model can assist educators in devising personalized learning plans.

However, existing mainstream KT models explore the importance of knowledge relations but ignore the key role of cognitive factors. According to the knowledge construction theory, the human cognitive system performs both spatial accommodation and temporal assimilation to internalize knowledge. In this paper, we propose an innovative heterogeneous graph-based Knowledge tracing method with spatiotemporal evolution (TSKT), in which knowledge state evolution is traced along both temporal and spatial dimensions. We construct a heterogeneous graph with multiple exercise attributes, including content, concepts, and difficulty, to obtain a knowledge space with richer exercise representations through hierarchical aggregation. We design a spatial updating module in which each interaction updates the current node's state of the knowledge space and transfers its influence to its neighbors. We also design a temporal updating module to further update the knowledge state through short-term memory enhancing and long-term memory forgetting. Finally, we stack these modules to obtain deeper features by using alternate spatiotemporal updating. Extensive experiments on three datasets reveal the superiority of the proposed method and its variants in terms of future performance prediction.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners' performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners' activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.
