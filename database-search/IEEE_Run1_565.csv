The Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) Student Model is a time-tested method that maintains information about students' knowledge levels for the different skills in the topic domain. In our previous work, we had proposed the Personalized, Clustered, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (PC-BKT) model that individualizes the learning of skills for each student and additionally improves the prediction for the cold start problem. A clustering of both students and skills based on a student and skill capability matrix was used to learn the prior skills to deal with the cold start problem, which is the prediction for either new skills or new students. Both the BKT and the PC-BKT models assume that a skill once learnt is never forgotten. But forgetting is pervasive. If a previously learnt skill is not used for a while, there is a higher chance of forgetting it. One of the factors that influence the forgetting is the time duration before the current attempt at using a skill and the previous attempt. We incorporate forgetting as a time decay function in the BKT and PC-BKT models and show significant increase in the accuracy of the student prediction.","","978-1-4799-7171-8","10.1109/CCIP.2015.7100688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100688","Bayesian Knowledge Tracing;BKT;PC-BKT;Student Models;User Models;Intelligent Tutoring Systems;ITS","Adaptation models;Predictive models;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Bayes methods;Algebra","belief networks;intelligent tutoring systems;matrix algebra","Bayesian knowledge tracing student model;intelligent tutoring systems;PC-BKT model;BKT model;time decay function;student prediction","","12","","19","IEEE","4 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The strength of LKT is the specification of a symbolic notation system for alternative logistic regression models that is powerful enough to specify many extant models in the literature and many new models. To demonstrate the generality of LKT, we fit 12 models, some variants of well-known models and some newly devised, to six learning technology datasets. The results indicated that no single learner model was best in all cases, further justifying a broad approach that considers multiple learner model features and the learning context. We introduce features to stand in for student-level intercepts and argue that to be maximally applicable, a learner model needs to adapt to student differences.

It is challenging to predict students' performance in the future period based on a small number of samples in practice. In this paper, we propose a deep knowledge tracing model based on Bayesian inference (TBKT). Specifically, a priori data subsets are formed by sampling the training data, and data augmentation is performed on the data subsets by Bayesian regression.

Knowledge tracing is one of the most popular technologies for this purpose, and deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Compared to classical models, such as Bayesian knowledge tracing, which track students' knowledge proficiencies, deep learning-based knowledge tracing is usually modeled to predict students' performances on questions, while ignoring the interpretability of students' knowledge states. However, for many practical applications, such as learning resource recommendation, it would be more helpful if we could explicitly track students' abilities or knowledge proficiencies separately from performance prediction. Researchers in psychometric area already designed cognitive diagnosis solutions to quantify the knowledge states of students in static conditions (e.g., examination), where the educational priors (i.e., factors related to students' learning process) were proved beneficial for student modeling. Inspired by this, we propose dynamic cognitive diagnosis, which integrates the interpretability of educational priors from cognitive diagnosis into deep learning-based knowledge tracing methods. We first discuss and provide evidence of which educational priors can be integrated, including question attributes and interaction function. Then we show the effects of using the educational priors in deep learning-based knowledge tracing from two aspects, i.e., interpretability and accuracy. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we prove that properly chosen priors can enable deep learning-based methods to evaluate students' knowledge states in a manner that is consistent with domain knowledge or human experience.

The model which uses RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) which has proved to be effective in modeling the student knowledge but has got its own limitations. We found that there were some features that were very important in predicting the performance of student but were ignored in the original DKT (Deep knowledge Tracing) model [1]. In this paper, we attempt to consider three more features such as No. of hints accessed, Student First Response Time and Number of Attempts when compared to DKT and use the same model as in DKT where the only change is made in the input vector we provide to the model. We also use certain techniques like dimensionality reduction by using autoencoder which helps in reducing the dimensionality as we are taking extra features into consideration.","","978-1-5386-8075-9","10.1109/I2CT45611.2019.9033598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9033598","Autoencoder;Recurrent Neural Network (RNN);Online tutoring systems;Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT)","Hidden Markov models;Encoding;Recurrent neural networks;Knowledge engineering;Time factors;Mathematical model;Predictive models","intelligent tutoring systems;recurrent neural nets","design curriculum;student knowledge;recurrent neural networks;deep knowledge tracing model;online tutoring systems;DKT;extra student attributes;student first response time","","1","","18","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing KT methods leverage students' online question-answering logs to infer their knowledge state and predict their subsequent performance. However, these methods only focus on students' online behaviors without considering the fact that students' knowledge also evolves offline. Specifically, students have plenty of offline learning actions that also make changes in their knowledge state, which is called the offline knowledge evolution effect in this paper. However, these offline actions are not recorded by online learning systems, therefore leading to unreliable knowledge tracing results. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel model named offline-aware knowledge tracing (OKT) that considers students' offline knowledge evolution for KT. In O KT, we introduce a novel concept named offline trait to represent student's offline learning action preference. Based on the preference, the model evaluates offline knowledge evolution, and apply the evolution to generate a new knowledge state for students' future performance prediction. To the end, we conduct experiments on three real-world benchmark datasets and demonstrate that OKT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The model of the student in our system is inferred using a higher level LA, referred to as a meta-LA , which attempts to characterize the learning model of the students (or student simulators), while the latter use the tutorial-like system. The meta-LA , in turn, uses LAs as a learning mechanism to try to determine if the student in question is a fast, normal, or slow learner. The ultimate long-term goal of the exercise is the following: if the tutorial- like system can understand how the student perceives and processes knowledge, it will be able to customize the way by which it communicates the knowledge to the student to attain an optimal teaching strategy. The proposed meta-LA scheme has been tested for numerous environments, including the established benchmarks, and the results obtained are remarkable. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first published result that infers the learning model of an LA when it is externally treated as a black box, whose outputs are the only observable quantities. Additionally, our paper represents a new class of multiautomata systems, where the meta-LA synchronously communicates with the students, also modeled using LAs. The meta-LA's environment ¿observes¿ the progress of the student LA, and the response of the latter to the meta-LA actions is based on these observations.

To solve these issues, we propose herein a novel model, called the knowledge interaction-enhanced knowledge tracing (KIKT), to estimate and trace the evolution of learners' KP. We first propose a framework by unifying the strength of the memory network to enhance the representation of the knowledge state and the interpretability of the Item Response Theory to explain learner performance. In this framework, we trace each learner's KP on each knowledge concept overtime, and further infer their proficiencies and the item characteristics using two kinds of neural networks. Moreover, we incorporate the knowledge interaction and the cognitive difficulty into our model to further exploit the long-term dependencies and the adaptive item difficulty in the exercising sequences.

A recent enhancement to the BKT model is the BKT-PPS (Prior Per Student) which introduces a prior learnt for each student. Although this method demonstrates improved prediction results compared to the others, there are several aspects that limit its usefulness; (a) for a student, the prior learning is common for all skills, however in reality, it varies for each skill (b) Different students have varying learning capabilities; therefore these students cannot be considered as a homogenous group. In this paper, we aim to improve the prediction of student performance using an enhanced BKT model called the PC-BKT (Personalized & Clustered) with individual priors for each student and skill, and dynamic clustering of students based on changing learning ability.

While it is beneficial to customise learning material to fit individual learning progress, the widely different learning pace of students in an introductory programming course has made it impractical for teachers to track the knowledge acquisition of individual. Hence, many recent works take a data-driven approach to model students' learning progress based on the performance data in programming-related exercises, which include the submitted program codes and answers to closed-ended programming exercises. By analyzing these performance data, a system can evaluate the students' knowledge level of various concepts and skills in programming. This paper performs a systematic review and reports key information about recent works on programming knowledge tracing based on student performance data. An overview of the different choices of knowledge representation, domain knowledge model, performance measure and knowledge tracing algorithms is provided. The nature and granularity of knowledge components and the relationships between them are compared across the reviewed works. The different choice of programming knowledge representation leads to varied methods to assess knowledge levels from empirical performance data in programming-related exercises. Two broad categories of works are identified. The first is to overlay a student model on the domain knowledge model, and the student knowledge levels are updated in distinct time steps. The second trains temporal knowledge tracing models to predict students' future performance based on their performance in previous exercises. In addition, this review discusses the distinct challenges in knowledge tracing in programming education. It also points out limitations in current works and opportunities to improve knowledge tracing in learning programming.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637323","systematic review;computer science;programming education;student modelling;knowledge tracing","Systematics;Codes;Knowledge acquisition;Conferences;Education;Knowledge representation;Predictive models","computer science education;educational courses;programming","programming-related exercises;submitted program codes;student performance data;domain knowledge model;knowledge tracing;knowledge components;programming knowledge representation;empirical performance data;student model;student knowledge levels;temporal knowledge;programming education;programming learning;systematic literature review;learning material;individual learning progress;learning pace;introductory programming course","","2","","36","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the deep knowledge tracing model does not carry out in-depth analysis of knowledge interaction, leading to its poor interpretability.

The advantage of such an approach through Bayesian Networks (Formal framework of Uncertainty) is that this structural model allows substantial simplification when specifying parameters (Conditional Probabilities) which measures student ability at different levels of granularity. In addition, the probabilistic student model is proved to be quicker, more accurate and more efficient.

In the context of lifelong learning, the learner model is a user learning pattern, which can be modelled all the time based on user interaction with various sources. The main issue in lifelong learner model design is what type of information needs to be stored in the learner model and how the information granularity is involved. The type and level of information granularity of a user will determine how appropriate the pedagogical policies are to be provided by the system for a user. Lifelong learner model design should be in line with the principles of lifelong learning, namely sociality, interoperability, and scrutability. This paper discusses our research on learner model ontology for lifelong learning. The goal expected to be achieved is that there is a lifelong learner model ontology to be accessed and updated by adaptive learning systems. This research classifies learners' attributes into two groups, which are static and dynamic attributes. Static attributes tend not to change or very rarely change. They include learner's profile, special needs, aptitude, preference, learning approach, learning style, personality, and cognitive capability. On the other hand, dynamic attributes include learning history and study plan. Through conducting some experiments, it can be concluded that LifeOn supports ubiquitous and lifelong learning, and can be used in adaptive learning systems with various learner models.","2165-9567","978-1-5386-2957-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8363321","LifeOn;ontology;learner model;adaptive learning;ubiquitous learning lifelong learning","Adaptation models;Ontologies;Adaptive learning;Data models;Learning systems;Computational modeling;Interoperability","computer aided instruction;continuing professional development;mobile learning;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","adaptive learning systems;user learning pattern;lifelong learner model design;LifeOn;ubiquitous lifelong learner model ontology;learner profiles;information granularity;sociality;interoperability;scrutability;static attributes;dynamic attributes;learner aptitude;learner preference;learning approach;learning style;learner personality;cognitive capability","","8","","15","IEEE","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, we find that side factors (e.g., template and hint) are helpful to reflect the individualized difficulties of different exercises covering the same skill by analysing data. Therefore, we introduce an extensible embedding framework to synthesize skill, exercise, performance factors and side factors, dubbed BPS. BPS consists of three components: base embedding, performance embedding and side embedding which allows one or more side factors related to the difficulty of exercise to be extended in BPS.

The traditional cognitive diagnosis model's terms are suitable for the student abilities analysis, but they rely on handcrafted interaction functions and only use student's response records so that it is difficult to capture the dynamic knowledge mastery ability of students. Although using the knowledge tracing to enhance cognitive diagnosis is a meaningful attempt towards towards capturing student performance, the RNN-based know-eledge tracing model have limited effect. This paper proposes a new model, named GKT-CD, which fuses knowledge tracing and cognitive diagnosis in a synergistic framework. In GKT-CD, we develop Gated-GNN to trace the student-knowledge response records and extract students' latent trait. And then, we use hierarchical structure in knowledge to construct exercise latent vector. At last, we use two-dimensional item response theory (IRT) to predict the probability of students answering exercises correctly. Extensive experiments conducted on realworld datasets show that the GKT-CD model is feasible and obtain excellent performance.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-3900-8","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9533298","Adaptive Learning System;Cognitive Diagnosis;Item Response Theory;Knowledge Tracing;Graph Neural Network","Adaptation models;Adaptive learning;Analytical models;Fuses;Neural networks;Estimation;Logic gates","cognition;distance learning;educational courses;graph theory;intelligent tutoring systems","cognitive diagnosis model enhanced;graph-based knowledge tracing;online education platforms;adaptive learning system;coursework exercises;directed exercises;student abilities analysis;student-knowledge response records;exercise latent vector;GKT-CD model;RNN-based knowledge tracing model;two-dimensional item response theory","","2","","52","IEEE","20 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a skill assessment system which adopts a hybrid model that consists of deep knowledge tracing and user feedback sentiment analysis. DKT is an algorithm that uses the Recurrent Neural Networks to track the improvement of each individual on a particular skill. The project also delivers the findings on a user level, by the creation of a website named “SkillCrest”. This website shows the primary information on skill development and helps the tutors to identify which skill a student lacks using DKT. This feature can also be used for self-assessment of a student. We also incorporated a sentiment analysis component in our website to analyze the feedback given by each individual. The implementation of sentiment analysis is proposed to be done using the Recurrent Neural Networks.

Knowledge tracing (KT), as a key technology, aims to model learners’ knowledge states through the interactions between learners and learning resources, and predicts their future performance. However, the problem of interaction sparsity in educational resources leads to the fact that simple representations of questions usually fail to accurately capture students’ knowledge states. In this paper, inspired by the data-driven paradigm, we propose a novel knowledge tracing method named weighted heterogeneous graph-based Three-view Contrastive Learning framework for Knowledge Tracing (TCL4KT). Technically, three different view encoders in TCL4KT complement each other to obtain question embeddings with rich information. Specifically, TCL4KT considers the semantic information of higher-order, heterogeneous and the downstream task on a weighted heterogeneous graph of KT to learn high-quality representations. Besides, a meta-path-based positive sample selection strategy and joint contrastive loss are employed to gain better prediction performance. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of TCL4KT over baseline models, and further analysis verifies the effectiveness of our three-view contrastive learning framework.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2023.3293953","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:CCNU22LJ005); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M682454); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62077017,62077021,62107017,62293554); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2022CFB414); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10178056","Heterogeneous graph;Contrastive learning;Knowledge tracing;Personalized e-learning systems","Task analysis;Hidden Markov models;Electronic learning;Knowledge engineering;Deep learning;Data mining;Sun","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Representation learning of students’ behavior data is challenging because whether time sequences and interactive behaviors or the correlation between knowledge points and students carrying important information.

Machine learning-based methods require manual feature extraction and a large amount of prior knowledge. Although deep learning-based methods can automatically extract features, most methods either only use the time series information of the data, or use the association between knowledge points. All the methods ignore the association between knowledge points and students. To fill this gap, we propose a Gated Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (GHGCN) model. We utilize the encoder-decoder framework to predict student performance using the representations of nodes, which is learned from heterogeneous convolutional networks and gate recurrent unit.

From the viewpoint of data structure, the coursework can be potentially structured as a graph. Incorporating this graph-structured nature into the knowledge tracing model as a relational inductive bias can improve its performance; however, previous methods, such as deep knowledge tracing, did not consider such a latent graph structure. Inspired by the recent successes of the graph neural network (GNN), we herein propose a GNN-based knowledge tracing method, i.e., graph-based knowledge tracing. Casting the knowledge structure as a graph enabled us to reformulate the knowledge tracing task as a time-series node-level classification problem in the GNN. As the knowledge graph structure is not explicitly provided in most cases, we propose various implementations of the graph structure. Empirical validations on two open datasets indicated that our method could potentially improve the prediction of student performance and demonstrated more interpretable predictions compared to those of the previous methods, without the requirement of any additional information.","","978-1-4503-6934-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8909656","Knowledge tracing;Graph neural network;Educational data mining;Learning sciences","Neural networks;Predictive models;Knowledge engineering;Learning systems;Data models;Computational modeling;Data structures","computer aided instruction;data structures;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","student proficiency;graph neural network;computer-assisted learning systems;student performance;data structure;graph-structured nature;knowledge tracing model;deep knowledge tracing;latent graph structure;GNN-based knowledge;graph-based knowledge tracing;knowledge graph structure;time-series node-level classification problem","","29","","25","","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, the method called Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which leverages recurrent neural networks, shows remarkable performance; however, existing knowledge tracing methods, including DKT, require human-predefined skill-tags that show what skill is required to solve a question. This limits the optimization of modeling student proficiency and the application to real-world data, which are often not well-organized by skill-tags. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end DKT model (E2E-DKT), which does not depend on any human-predefined skill-tags. Regarding the correspondence between questions and tags as a binary embedding matrix, we introduce a new Q-Embedding Model, which learns the embedding matrix to help predict student proficiency from the student question-answer logs only. We provided two techniques for learning a better matrix, one is the reconstruction regularization of question-space and tag-space, and the other is the sparse regularization of the question-embedding matrix. Using two open datasets, we empirically validated that the learned tags show the same or better performance on DKT and have an information-efficient structure and more hierarchical relations among each tag than the human-predefined tags. These results show the potential of our proposed method to enhance the applicable scope and effectiveness of DKT, which could help improve the learning experience of students in more diverse environments.","2375-9259","978-1-5386-9288-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8637535","Knowledge tracing, Deep Knowledge Tracing, Binary embedding, Educational data mining, Learning sciences","Predictive models;Sparse matrices;Knowledge engineering;Recurrent neural networks;Task analysis;Analytical models","computer aided instruction;knowledge management;matrix algebra;recurrent neural nets","computer-assisted learning systems;student proficiency;recurrent neural networks;human-predefined skill-tags;end-to-end DKT model;E2E-DKT;binary embedding matrix;Q-Embedding Model;question-embedding matrix;end-to-end deep knowledge tracing;binary question-embedding learning","","2","","21","IEEE","10 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there is still a problem in the online learning system that teachers and students cannot communicate face-to-face in time and care about students' learning status, so if there is not a proper analysis of students' performance, it will lead to poor learning conditions. There have been many pieces of research about knowledge tracing in the past. Nonetheless, we found that the knowledge tracing models cannot optimally predict students' proficiency in knowledge concepts in some online learning environments such as QSticker. Therefore, we proposed a Proficiency Prediction System based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Since many students have similar trajectories in learning, the system uses the most straightforward exercise answering behavior data, including the correctness of his answer and the knowledge concept correlations. It then calculates other characteristics, such as the difficulty of each knowledge concept, to predict students' proficiency in all knowledge concepts in the course. The accomplished experiments show that our model can achieve 71% accuracy on the collected dataset. With the help of this system, we can predict the difficulties students may encounter in the learning process.

The student model is initialized by presenting a pre-test form to students and it is updated dynamically according to their study times and assessment results. Students' knowledge status are modeled through three phases, initialization, training and recall phases. In the initialization phase, input vectors are normalized before they are categorized using unsupervised algorithm Fuzzy-ART2 in 6 clusters representing 6 knowledge status. A HMM is created for each cluster and when new students' parameters are collected, they are introduced to Baum- Welch re-estimation algorithm to train the 6 HMMs and to maximize the observed sequence that is associated with a particular cluster. Forward algorithm evaluates then the likelihood of this sequence with respect to each of the HMMs and to determine the maximum value, which represents the actual knowledge status of the student.

Knowledge tracing aims to model student knowledge state given the student’s sequence of learning activities. Modern Knowledge tracing (KT) is usually formulated as a supervised sequence learning problem to predict students’ future practice performance according to their past observed practice scores by summarizing student knowledge state as a set of evolving hidden variables. Because of this formulation, many current KT solutions are not fit f or modeling student learning from non-assessed learning activities with no explicit feedback or score observation (e.g., watching video lectures that are not graded). Additionally, these models cannot explicitly represent the dynamics of knowledge transfer among different learning activities, particularly between the assessed (e.g., quizzes) and non-assessed (e.g., video lectures) learning activities. In this paper, we propose Transition-Aware Multi-activity Knowledge Tracing (TAMKOT), which models knowledge transfer between learning materials, in addition to student knowledge, when students transition between and within assessed and non-assessed learning materials. TAMKOT is formulated as a deep recurrent multi-activity learning model that explicitly learns knowledge transfer by activating and learning a set of knowledge transfer matrices, one for each transition type between student activities. Accordingly, our model allows for representing each material type in a different yet transferrable latent space while maintaining student knowledge in a shared space. We evaluate our model on three real-world publicly available datasets and demonstrate TAMKOT’s capability in predicting student performance and modeling knowledge transfer.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020617","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020617","knowledge tracing;knowledge transfer;multi--activity;massive open online courses;student knowledge modeling;multiple learning material types","Training;Learning systems;Predictive models;Big Data;Data models;Knowledge transfer","computer aided instruction","deep recurrent multiactivity learning model;explicit feedback;explicitly learns knowledge transfer;knowledge transfer matrices;KT solutions;large-scale online learning systems;learning materials;model student knowledge state;modeling knowledge transfer;models knowledge transfer;modern knowledge tracing;nonassessed learning activities;student activities;student performance;student training;supervised sequence learning problem;transition-aware multiactivity knowledge tracing","","1","","40","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key component for their personalization is the student model, which infers the knowledge level of the students to balance the difficulty of the exercises. While important advances have been achieved, several challenges remain. In particular, the models should be able to track in real-time the evolution of the students' knowledge levels. These evolutions are likely to follow different profiles for each student, while measuring the exact knowledge level remains difficult given the limited and noisy information provided by the interactions. This paper introduces a novel model that addresses these challenges with three contributions:. 1) the model relies on Gaussian Processes to track online the evolution of the student's knowledge level over time, 2) it uses collaborative filtering to rapidly provide long-term predictions by leveraging the information from previous users, and 3) it automatically generates abstract representations of knowledge components via automatic relevance determination of covariance matrices. The model is evaluated on three datasets, including real users. The results demonstrate that the model converges to accurate predictions in average four times faster than the compared methods.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2912367","EU Horizon2020 Project PAL(grant numbers:643783-RIA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8697129","Student model;knowledge level estimation;machine learning;Gaussian processes","Hidden Markov models;Predictive models;Data models;Task analysis;Adaptation models;Knowledge engineering;Production facilities","collaborative filtering;covariance matrices;Gaussian processes;intelligent tutoring systems;learning (artificial intelligence);user modelling","data-driven student models;intelligent tutoring systems;optimal learning experiences;personalized learning experiences;student model;exact knowledge level;limited information;noisy information;collaborative filtering;knowledge components;online knowledge level tracking","","10","","62","IEEE","23 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on individual difference of learners' abilities and preferred learning styles in hypermedia environment, the learning outcomes vary essentially. Meanwhile, with the development of E-Learning technologies, learners can be provided more effective learning environment to optimize their learning. Adaptive E-Learning systems are built to personalize and adapt e-learning content, pedagogical models, and interactions between participants in the environment to meet the individual needs and preferences of users if and when they arise. The learner model is an essential component in adaptive E-Learning Systems since it is used to modify the interaction between system and learners to suit the needs of individual learners. While learner model plays an important role in the personalization of E-Learning systems, it is seen as a part of the e-learning system in many applications. In our paper, we first explain the reason of why this issue prevents the E-Learning systems to provide better personalized support to meet the individual learning requirements. Then we propose a novel centralized learner model technique for Learning systems to overcome those problems. To E-achieve the goal to design a Learner Model for distributed systems meeting the requirements, the paper introduce five work steps: Analyze E-Learning standards, Articulate Modeling Requirements, Develop the Representation of Learning Styles, Generate Learner Activity Ontology and Design the Learner Model. Finally, we illustrate the architectural design of modeling system.","","0-7803-9521-2","10.1109/ICTTA.2006.1684441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1684441","","Electronic learning;Adaptive systems;Earthquakes;Standards development;Ontologies;Information retrieval;System testing;Web pages","computer aided instruction;distributed processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","personalization;distributed e-learning systems;adaptive e-learning systems;centralized learner model;learner activity ontology","","7","","10","IEEE","16 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research has shown that existing deep learning-based knowledge tracing models only consider the training and outcomes of students as inputs, ignoring the rich behavioral information generated by students during the learning process. This information can provide a clearer understanding of students’ mastery of the knowledge points. In this study, a deep learning knowledge tracing model based on a dynamic key-value memory network model with strong interpretability is selected as the foundation. The XGBoost decision tree algorithm is used to preprocess the student’s behavioral information, capturing the impact of student behavioral factors on their cognitive states, and integrating the classification results with the learning features.

However, there are two crucial issues in deep learning-based KT models. First, the knowledge concepts are used to predict learners' performance instead of exercises. This choice ignores the actual difference among exercises, which leads to the KT model's inability to explore the rich information at the exercise level, thus, weakening the KT model's performance. Second, the actual difference in prior knowledge is neglected. Therefore, in-depth research of these two types of the actual differences offers the possibility to improve the prediction performance of KT further. To this end, we propose a fine-grained knowledge tracing model (FGKT)1 to capture these two types of actual differences. We first obtain the exercise representations by considering the corresponding knowledge concepts and actual difference among exercises. Then, an effective attention mechanism is designed to capture the relevance between assessment exercises and historical interactions to acquire individual prior knowledge. Finally, we evaluate the proposed FGKT model on several available benchmark datasets. The experiment results show that our model surpasses benchmark KT models by up to 7% in prediction performance on the latest ASSISTments dataset.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2023.3259013","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772210,U1911201); Project of Science and Technology in Guangzhou in China(grant numbers:202007040006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076899","Adaptive learning;attention mechanism;intel- ligent tutoring systems;knowledge tracing (KT);personalized e-learning","Hidden Markov models;Predictive models;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Training;Probabilistic logic;Estimation","deep learning (artificial intelligence);intelligent tutoring systems","adaptive learning;assessment exercises;ASSISTments dataset;deep learning-based KT models;exercise representations;FGKT;fine-grained knowledge tracing model;intelligent tutoring systems","","","","47","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this situation, knowledge tracing (KT), which tracks a student’s mastery of specific knowledge concepts, is receiving increasing attention. KT utilizes a sequence of studentexercise interactive activities to predict the mastery of concepts corresponding to a target problem, recommending appropriate learning resources to students and optimizing learning sequences for adaptive learning. With the development of deep learning, various studies have been proposed, such as sequential models using recurrent neural networks, attention models influenced by transformers, and graph-based models that depict the relationships between knowledge concepts. However, they all have common limitations in that they cannot utilize the learning activities of students other than the target student and can only use a limited form of exercise information. In this study, we have applied the concept of rating prediction to the studentexercise knowledge tracing problem and solved the limitations of the existing models. Our proposed Inductive Graph-based Knowledge Tracing (IGKT) designed to integrate structural information and various unrestricted types of additional information into the model through subgraph sampling, has been found superior over the existing models across two different datasets in predicting student performances.","2375-9356","978-1-6654-7578-5","10.1109/BigComp57234.2023.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066831","knowledge tracing;graph-based knowledge tracing;IGMC;IGKT;rating prediction","Knowledge engineering;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Target tracking;Recurrent neural networks;Pandemics;Predictive models","computer aided instruction;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;epidemics;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets","adaptive learning;appropriate learning resources;attention models;COVID-19 pandemic;deep learning;Inductive Graph-based Knowledge Tracing;KT;learning activities;optimizing learning sequences;sequential models;specific knowledge concepts;student performances;studentexercise interactive activities;studentexercise knowledge;target student;virtual education","","","","24","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The task of KT is to help students learn more effectively by predicting their next mastery of knowledge based on their historical exercise sequences. Nowadays, many related works have emerged in this field, such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and deep knowledge tracing methods. Despite the progress that has been made in KT, existing techniques still have the following limitations: 1) Previous studies address KT by only exploring the observational sparsity data distribution, and the counterfactual data distribution has been largely ignored. 2) Current works designed for KT only consider either the entity relationships between questions and concepts, or the relations between two concepts, and none of them investigates the relations among students, questions, and concepts, simultaneously, leading to inaccurate student modeling. To address the above limitations, we propose a graph counterfactual augmentation method for knowledge tracing. Concretely, to consider the multiple relationships among different entities, we first uniform students, questions, and concepts in graphs, and then leverage a heterogeneous graph convolutional network to conduct representation learning. To model the counterfactual world, we conduct counterfactual transformations on students' learning graphs by changing the corresponding treatments and then exploit the counterfactual outcomes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GraphCA method compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2023.123678","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62372277); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2022MF257,ZR2022MF295); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10266657","Contrastive learning;counterfactual representation;graph neural network;knowledge tracing","Representation learning;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge based systems;Data models;Bayes methods;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems","Bayesian knowledge tracing;contrastive learning framework;counterfactual data distribution;counterfactual outcomes;counterfactual transformations;counterfactual world;deep knowledge tracing methods;graph counterfactual augmentation method;heterogeneous graph convolutional network;inaccurate student modeling;increasingly significant role;KT;observational sparsity data distribution;online learning;representation learning;uniform students","","","","70","","28 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the propagated influence among concepts, which has been shown to be a key factor in human learning by the educational theories, is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Structure-based Knowledge Tracing (SKT), which exploits the multiple relations in knowledge structure to model the influence propagation among concepts. In the SKT framework, we not only consider the temporal effect on the exercising sequence but also take the spatial effect on the knowledge structure into account. We take advantages of two novel formulations in modeling the influence propagation on the knowledge structure with multiple relations. For undirected relations such as similarity relations, the synchronization propagation method is adopted, where the influence propagates bidirectionally between neighbor concepts. For directed relations such as prerequisite relations, the partial propagation method is applied, where the influence can only unidirectionally propagate from a predecessor to a successor. Meanwhile, we employ the gated functions to update the states of concepts temporally and spatially. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of SKT.","2374-8486","978-1-7281-8316-9","10.1109/ICDM50108.2020.00063","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61922073,61672483,U1605251); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9338285","Transfer of knowledge;Knowledge Tracing;Influence Propagation;Recurrent Neural Network","Neural networks;Education;Logic gates;Synchronization;Mathematical model;Data mining;Task analysis","data visualisation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);educational administrative data processing;graph theory;knowledge based systems;knowledge representation;recurrent neural nets","Deep Knowledge Tracing;knowledge structure;Structure-based Knowledge Tracing;synchronization propagation method;partial propagation method;influence propagation view;learner knowledge state;SKT;online education;temporal effect;spatial effect;gated functions","","27","","41","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, for problems where we have few amounts of data for training, the generalization power will be low, the models will tend to give good results on classes containing many examples and poor results on those with few examples. Theses problems are frequent in educational data where for example, there are skills that are very difficult (floor) or very easy to master (ceiling). There will be less data on students that correctly answered questions related to difficult knowledge and that incorrectly answered questions related to knowledge easy to master. In that case, the DKT is unable to correctly predict the student's answers to questions associated with those skills. To improve the DKT, we penalize the model using a 'cost-sensitive' technique. To overcome the problem of the few amounts of data, we propose a hybrid model combining the DKT and expert knowledge. Thus, the DKT is combined with a Bayesian Network (built from domain experts) by using the attention mechanism. The resulting model can accurately track knowledge of students in Logic-Muse Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), compared to the BKT and the original DKT.","2375-0197","978-1-7281-3798-8","10.1109/ICTAI.2019.00217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8995203","Deep Knowledge Tracing, Bayesian Network, Knowledge Tracing","","Bayes methods;belief networks;intelligent tutoring systems;learning (artificial intelligence)","Deep Knowledge Tracing;machine learning approaches;training step;generalization power;educational data;incorrectly answered questions;hybrid model;DKT knowledge;expert knowledge;original DKT;logic-muse intelligent tutoring system","","4","","22","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to address this issue, we advocate for and propose to incorporate the knowledge structure information, especially the prerequisite relations between pedagogical concepts, into the knowledge tracing model. Specifically, by considering how students master pedagogical concepts and their prerequisites, we model prerequisite concept pairs as ordering pairs. With a proper mathematical formulation, this property can be utilized as constraints in designing knowledge tracing model. As a result, the obtained model can have a better performance on student concept mastery prediction.

To overcome the imbalanced issue, some balancing methods are applied.

However, the effect of multiple skills in the question is not distinguished, and various learning behaviors need to be better modeled. In this article, we propose a knowledge-associated embedding for the memory-aware KT (KMKT) framework. Specifically, we first construct a question-skill bipartite graph with attribute features. A knowledge-associated embedding (KAE) module is proposed to capture the distinctiveness of multiskills via the process of knowledge propagation and knowledge aggregation based on predefined knowledge-paths. Then, to simulate the memory recall phenomenon of the learners in KT, we design a memory-aware module for long short-term memory (MA-LSTM) networks. A temporal attention layer in MA-LSTM is proposed to learn the forgetting mechanism of the human brain. Finally, we introduce a learning-gain (LG) layer to obtain learners’ benefits after each exercise.

In this paper, a novel model called Skill-oriented Hierarchical structure for Deep Knowledge Tracing (SHDKT) is proposed to discover the relations between questions, which are implicit in the hierarchical skill structure. SHDKT comprises three modules. First, The skill concurrency graph (SCG) is constructed by incorporating students' response infor-mation into the question-skill bipartite graph, which contains both sequence and co-occurrence relations between skills. Second, a hierarchical skill representation module (HSRM) is proposed to exploit the hierarchical information of skills based on the SCG. Finally, a question representation module (QRM) is presented by learning explicit and implicit interactions of question side infor-mation. Hence we can predict the student response accurately through question representation.

From the perspective of MAS based e-learning systems, learner models and learning resources are part of the environment of the agents and agents interact with them constantly. Thus, we proposed an e-learning architecture that focuses on environment abstraction and models access to different learner models and learning resources with artifacts to support personalization. In MAS based e-learning systems with the same functionality, specific agents are responsible for modeling learner information and retrieving learning resources. However, in the proposed approach, by exploiting A&A Metamodel, this operations are performed by artifacts to provide a more flexible and scalable solution. The proposed adaptive e-learning environment architecture is developed as a prototype with CArtAgO framework.

It aims at dynamically estimate students' knowledge status based on history answer records and predict whether they will answer the next question correctly. Predicting students' knowledge is a difficult task because student learning is a dynamic process and students' knowledge status is constantly changing. However, existing approaches often ignore the fact of students' stage development of learning ability and do not take into account the impact of short-term knowledge states on the next moment. Existing models do not emphasize the importance of students' long-term knowledge states and short-term knowledge states. In this paper, we propose a new Long- and Short-term Attention network Knowledge Tracing model (LSAKT). Specifically, we divided the sequences into subsequences based on time stamps, with the first attention layer learning the student's long-term knowledge state based on the interactional performance with the problem, while the other attention layer learns the student's short-term knowledge state based on the last sequence. Finally, we integrate the long-term knowledge state and the short-term knowledge state to form the student's final knowledge state. We evaluated the proposed model on four publicly available datasets, and the experimental results showed that the LSAKT approach achieved a fantastic result.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9891896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9891896","Knowledge tracing;Long-term knowledge states and short-term knowledge states;Attention networks;Intelligent online education","Knowledge engineering;Measurement;Education;Neural networks;History;Task analysis","computer aided instruction","short-term knowledge state;attention layer;long-term knowledge state;student learning;long-term and short-term attention network knowledge tracing model;LSAKT approach;intelligent online education","","","","32","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If a learning process involves both cognitive and affective dimensions, then learning is like to be more usable, socially appropriate, acceptable and memorable, ultimately leading to significant improvement in the learner’s performance and the learning experience.

To address this issue, we propose a learner modelling mechanism for monitoring learners' actions when constructing/exploring models by modelling sequences of actions reflecting different strategies in solving a task. This is based on a modified version of case-based reasoning for problems with multiple solutions. In our formulation, approaches to explore the task are represented as sequences of simple cases linked by temporal and dependency relations, which are mapped to the learners' behavior in the system by means of appropriate similarity metrics.

The implementation of a Tutoring Model includes both the formal representation of the aforementioned rules and a mechanism able to interpret such representation and execute the rules. One of the most suitable approaches to formally represent pedagogical rules is to construct semantic web ontologies that are highly interoperable and can be integrated with other models in an ITS like the subject domain and the student model. However, the main drawback of semantic web-based approaches is that they require a considerable human effort to prepare and build relevant ontologies. This paper proposes a novel approach to maintain the benefits of the semantic web-based approach in representing pedagogical rules for an ITS, while overcoming its main drawback by employing a data mining technique to automatically extract rules from real-world tutoring sessions and represent them by means of Web Ontology Language (OWL).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979281","Italian Ministry of University and Research(grant numbers:INF@NZIA DIGI.tales 3.6 (specifically under the Work Package 2)); PON Research and Competitiveness, from 2007 to 2013???http://www.infanziadigitales.it/en; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9031710","Classification rule mining;intelligent tutoring systems;ontologies;pedagogical rules;semantic web;web ontology language (OWL)","OWL;Data mining;Ontologies;Task analysis;Adaptation models;Data models;Solid modeling","data mining;intelligent tutoring systems;knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","intelligent tutoring systems;formal representation;aforementioned rules;pedagogical rules;semantic Web ontologies;student model;semantic Web-based approach;data mining technique;real-world tutoring sessions;Web Ontology Language;ontology-driven tutoring models","","32","","58","CCBY","10 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, existing approaches can only exploit the exercising records of students, and the problem of extracting rich information existed in the materials (e.g., knowledge concepts, exercise content) of exercises to achieve both more precise prediction of student performance and more interpretable analysis of knowledge acquisition remains underexplored. To this end, in this paper, we present a holistic study of student performance prediction. To directly achieve the primary goal of performance prediction, we first propose a general Exercise-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (EERNN) framework by exploring both student's exercising records and the text content of corresponding exercises. In EERNN, we simply summarize each student's state into an integrated vector and trace it with a recurrent neural network, where we design a bidirectional LSTM to learn the encoding of each exercise from its content. For making final predictions, we design two implementations on the basis of EERNN with different prediction strategies, i.e., EERNNM with Markov property and EERNNA with Attention mechanism. Then, to explicitly track student's knowledge acquisition on multiple knowledge concepts, we extend EERNN to an explainable Exercise-aware Knowledge Tracing (EKT) framework by incorporating the knowledge concept information, where the student's integrated state vector is now extended to a knowledge state matrix. In EKT, we further develop a memory network for quantifying how much each exercise can affect the mastery of students on multiple knowledge concepts during the exercising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate both EERNN and EKT frameworks on a large-scale real-world data. The results in both general and cold-start scenarios clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of two frameworks in student performance prediction as well as the superior interpretability of EKT.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2924374","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672483,U1605251,91746301); Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China & China Mobile(grant numbers:MCM20170507); Iflytek joint research program; Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS(grant numbers:2014299); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8744302","Intelligent education;knowledge tracing;exercise content;knowledge concept","Predictive models;Knowledge acquisition;Hidden Markov models;Task analysis;Recurrent neural networks;Data mining","educational computing;educational courses;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;recurrent neural nets","multiple knowledge concepts;EERNN;knowledge concept information;knowledge state matrix;exercising process;student performance prediction;knowledge acquisition;explainable exercise-aware knowledge tracing;student exercising records;exercise-enhanced recurrent neural network;bidirectional LSTM;proactive service offering;computer supported intelligent education","","134","","58","IEEE","24 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ANFIS model was designed using trial and error based on various experiments. This study was conducted to illustrate that ANFIS is effective with hybrid learning, for the adaptation of learning content according to learners' needs. Study results show that ANFIS has been successfully implemented for learning content adaptation within different learning context scenarios. The performance of the ANFIS model was evaluated using standard error measurements which revealed the optimal setting necessary for better predictability. The MATLAB simulation results indicate that the performance of the ANFIS approach is valuable and easy to implement. The study results are based on analysis of different model settings; they confirm that the m-learning application is functional. However, it should be noted that an increase in the number of inputs being considered by the model will increase the system response time, and hence the delay for the mobile learner.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2011.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104032","Adaptation models;Mobile communication;Context;Cognition;Adaptive systems;Machine learning;Learning systems;adaptation;Mobile learning;learner modeling;ANFIS","Adaptation models;Mobile communication;Context;Cognition;Adaptive systems;Machine learning;Learning systems","computer aided instruction;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;mobile computing","adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system;ANFIS model;mobile learning;m-learning;learning activities;learner model;learner profiles;learning content adaptation;trial-and-error;standard error measurements;MATLAB simulation","","175","","22","IEEE","13 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Opening the model in an understandable form provides additional methods of prompting reflection, planning, and other metacognitive activities that are important in learning. Learner-system discussion, editing or other interaction about the learner model can allow users to contribute more directly to the modeling process to increase its accuracy, while at the same time, further facilitating reflection as they justify their viewpoints to themselves and the system. Social learning can be supported by opening learner models to peers, helping learners to gauge their relative progress, and effectively seek collaborators. OLMs can also provide useful information to others supporting the learning process, such as teachers and parents.

The goal of developing AEHS is to achieve an effective and affective learning performance, as well as to get positive impacts on the student through gaining skills and learning experiences. Most AEHS are technologically-driven to transfer knowledge rather than pedagogically-driven focusing on gaining cognitive skills and other experiences. To overcome this gap many researchers considered Cognitive style (CS) as the most important factor for reasoning and predicting individual traits, learning strategies and other preferences. Furthermore many researchers proposed new cognitive factors- rational, intuitive, and interpersonal as the most innate, brain-based, fixed stable preferences to build a robust adaptive student model dynamically and to get positive influence on the affective and effective AEHS. Based on the literature review, we have identified a number of theoretical and technical issues related to the AEHS architecture in relation to the whole brain cognitive style model to achieve an effective learning outcomes.

In this paper, to provide an effective in-classroom learning environment for most students, we propose to develop appropriate instructional presentation methods to match diversity of learning styles. We demonstrate how to align in-class instructions, such as quizzes and other in-class learning activities, with students' learning styles. Our discussion, which primarily focuses on quantitative topics, relies on research in education and applied psychology, and our teaching experience.

The idea behind adaptive learning is the use of computer-based interactive systems fully capable of automatically adapting the presentation of learning content and material according to the learners' responses and progress when interacting with the systems. With English becoming increasingly important in the world today as an international language, it has been questioned as to whether adaptive learning can be utilized to facilitate the learning of English as a second language in non-English-speaking countries.

These learners may have very different learning backgrounds, knowledge levels, learning styles, and abilities. The `one size fit all' in an e-Learning systems is clearly a typical problem. To overcome this limitation and increase effective learning, adaptive and personalised learning is currently an active research area. This study presents a novel ontology-based approach to design an e-learning Decision support system which includes major adaptive features. The ontological learner, domain and content model are separately designed to support adaptive learning. The proposed system utilise the captured learner's model during the registration phase for determining learners' characteristics. The system also tracks learners' activities and tests during the learning process. Test results are analysed according to the Item Response Theory in order to calculate learner's abilities. The learner model is updated based on the result of activities, results of test and learner's ability for use in the adaptation process. The updated learner model is used to generate different learning paths for individual learners. In this study, the proposed system is implemented on the “Fraction topic” of mathematics domain.

Generally, student performance prediction is achieved by tracing the evolution of each student's knowledge states via a series of learning activities. Every learning activity record has two types of feature data: student behavior and exercise features. However, most methods use features that are related to exercises, such as correctness and concepts, while other student behavior features are usually ignored. The few studies that have focused on student behavior features through subjective manual selection argue that different student behavior features can be used in an equivalent manner to predict student performance. In this paper, we assume that the integration of student behavior features and exercise features is crucial to improve the precision of prediction, and each feature has a different impact on student performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework for student performance prediction by making full use of both student behavior features and exercise features and combining the attention mechanism with the knowledge tracing model. Specifically, we first exploit machine learning to capture feature representation automatically. Then, a fusion attention mechanism based on recurrent neural network architecture is used for student performance prediction. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness and practicability of our approach. The accuracy of our method is up to 98%, which is superior to previous methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033200","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1701402); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072160); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9235583","Student performance prediction;knowledge tracing;recurrent neural network;attention mechanism","Recurrent neural networks;Knowledge engineering;Deep learning;Predictive models;Education;Task analysis","feature extraction;intelligent tutoring systems;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets","student performance prediction;exercise features;multiple features fusion attention mechanism enhanced deep knowledge tracing;online learning systems;active learning;student behavior features;learning activity;subjective manual selection;feature representation;recurrent neural network architecture","","17","","27","CCBY","22 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, they focus on learning outcomes at a single learning interaction, while student progress at continuous learning interactions is more instructive. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for the KT task and propose a novel model named Learning Process-consistent Knowledge Tracing (LPKT), which captures the evolution of students’ knowledge state through monitoring their learning progress. Specifically, we utilize both the positive effect of the learning gain and the negative effect of forgetting in learning to calculate student progress in continuous learning interactions. Then, considering that the rate of progress is student-specific, we extend LPKT to LPKT-S by explicitly distinguishing the individual progress rate of each student. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that LPKT and LPKT-S could obtain more appropriate knowledge states in line with the learning process.

Therefore, fuzzy Bayesian KT models (namely, FBKT and T2FBKT) are proposed to address continuous score scenarios (e.g., subjective examinations) so that the applicability of KT models may be broadened. Moreover, fine-grained cognitive states can be discerned. In particular, referring to type-2 fuzzy theory, T2FBKT mitigates the model uncertainty of FBKT induced by uncertain parameters.

Despite all these promising elements, studies have shown that current educational games are not as effective as they could be. A lack of adaptive tutoring and feedback tools, lack of proper knowledge assessment, and badly designed gameplay are the most significant factors for their inefficiency. We propose to address these problems by using an Intelligent Tutoring System for computer games. The main components of this system are a student model based on Bayesian Networks and a multi-level tutoring model. The system is composed of one or more games based on a single or multiple educational topics.","","978-1-4244-5506-5","10.1109/T4E.2009.5314111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5314111","Interactive multimedia;educational games","Computer science education;Multimedia systems;Automatic testing;System testing;Psychology;Multimedia computing;Calibration;Graph theory;Game theory;Vocabulary","belief networks;computer games;intelligent tutoring systems;multimedia computing;user modelling","student modeling;online social Websites;educational Websites;online multimedia;computer games;psychophysical factor;educational games;adaptive tutoring;feedback tools;Intelligent Tutoring System;Bayesian networks;multilevel tutoring model","","3","","25","IEEE","6 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most LTSs rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for analyzing the student's answer to support him/her with appropriate feedback. In such systems, diagnosing the student errors is typically based on a large library of students' expected bugs. In addition, such systems (especially in case of the Arabic language) don't consider modeling of the student knowledge or assigning difficulty levels to the presented questions. Subsequently, such systems do not support individualization of their interactions to each student's needs and preferences. This paper presents the Arabic Grammar Tutor (AGTutor), which utilizes Constraint-Based Modeling (CBM) to model the domain eliminating the need for the bugs' library. Grammar rules are represented as a set of constraints that are categorized in terms of the different linguistic skills. Linguistic skills are classified into several levels and categories. Such hierarchical structure allows diagnosing the student errors in a more efficient way. In addition, modeling the student competence in the Arabic linguistic skills is also expressed in terms of a set of domain constraints. Assigning difficulty levels to each question according to the required skills and modeling the student knowledge allow the system to adapt its interactions according to the student week points to enhance his/her Arabic linguistic skills. Evaluation results have shown the effectiveness of AGTutor in tutoring the students and the satisfaction of both the students and the teachers with its features and capabilities.","","978-1-5386-6407-0","10.1109/ACCS-PEIT.2017.8302994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302994","Arabic;Constraint Based Modeling;Intelligent Tutoring Systems;Language Tutoring Systems","Pragmatics;Adaptation models;Grammar;Syntactics;Tools;Morphology","grammars;intelligent tutoring systems;linguistics;natural language processing","Arabic grammar tutor;LTSs;student errors;Arabic language;student knowledge;student competence;Arabic linguistic skills;domain constraints;natural language processing;grammar rules;multilevel skills-based student modeling;language tutoring systems;AGTutor","","1","","28","IEEE","1 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose SmartMe, which is an online learning system for university-level programming algorithm courses, where students can practice exercises to improve their algorithm skills. The questions are presented in the form of multiple-choice questions, which each question links one or more targeted skills. There are two main modules in SmartMe, which are OSLM and case example recommender. The recommender aimed to find case examples based on their similarities with questions and student models. For this study, we applied a cosine similarity algorithm and webbing matrix. To measure the usability of the OSLM and case example recommender, both modules were evaluated by experts and students. The results show that 80.58% of participants found that the combination of OSLM and the case example recommender is useful.

An adaptive e-learning system needs to deduce the learner model for adding personalization to instructional websites. The learner model is the perception repository about the e-content user, which can be inferred implicitly by employing meaningful semantic analysis of the text. In this research, a novel methodology is proposed to conceptually deduce the semantic learner model for personalized e-learning recommendations. Firstly, Conceptual Learner Model (CLM) is developed based on the learner's behavior and context-based text semantic representation by exploiting concepts from the ConceptNet knowledge base, with a significant association of patterns and rules. Then, Expanded Contextual Learner Model (ECLM) is developed by exploring the latent semantics in graphs to add concepts with the common-sense meanings that exceeded the named entities. The learner's knowledge graph is defined based on contextually associated concepts. Semantic relations in ConceptNet are exploited to extend learner models. The Normalized Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSO) algorithm is used to learn the importance of the relation types between the concepts. Thus, CLM and ECLM each are represented as a vector of weighted concepts in which updating is obtained automatically. The proposed recommendation system incorporates dynamic learner models to predict an appropriate e-content with the highest ranking, matching the true needs of a particular learner. Our simulation results show that the performance of ECLM is better Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) value 0.780 than other existing methods.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10246921","Personalized E-learning recommendation;contextual learner model;semantic analysis;knowledge graph;normalized PSO;prefix tree","Analytical models;Adaptation models;Social computing;Electronic learning;Computational modeling;Simulation;Semantics","","","","","","32","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

Towards this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Diverse Question Factors-enhanced Knowledge Tracing (DQFKT) method, which sufficiently explores various question factors to generate better prediction. On one hand, two reliable and low-dimensional student-concept connection spaces are established through exploiting the student-question-concept relations and individualization of question, and then fine-grained response representations of questions are obtained according to students’ responses. On the other hand, difficulty level with concrete concept for each question is introduced to simulate the complex interactions between students and questions for improving the prediction performance.

One of the main functions of an ITS system is to present its students with course materials that are most appropriate to their current knowledge of domain concepts, example being one of the course materials. ITS systems typically compare and analyze student model (SM) components for student's current knowledge of concepts (main topics, e.g. Scanf in C programming) that are required to understand the next example (e.g. Codes for scanf) suitable for learning a task (e.g. Write C code to read 2 integers from the keyboard). Existing systems such as NavEx and PADS perform an exhaustive matching of student knowledge level with all examples in the database. This research proposes a task-based technique for managing and classifying examples for more effective retrieval of relevant examples for learning a task. We propose a system called EASK for translating task and example solutions into concepts for similarity matching, which is more readily available, easily extendible and adaptable to other domains. Examples and tasks are represented as vectors of weights computed with term frequency measure TFIDF that signify the importance of a concept for an example. Examples most similar to a task are found by using a classification method called k-NN, which finds the closeness between different objects such as examples and tasks using cosine similarity measure and selecting the k objects (examples) with highest similarity scores. As a by-product, k-NN also predicts the class label (difficulty level) of the task. Our proposed model achieves this prediction with 89% accuracy.","","978-1-4799-6239-6","10.1109/CIT.2014.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984744","adaptation;data mining;classification;example-based Learning;student model","Vectors;Computational modeling;Materials;Indexes;Analytical models;Adaptation models","data mining;educational courses;intelligent tutoring systems;pattern classification","relevant example mining;ITS student models;intelligent tutoring system;course materials;C programming;NavEx systems;PADS systems;task-based technique;EASK;similarity matching;TFIDF;k-NN classification method;cosine similarity measure","","1","","8","IEEE","15 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most common tools is Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) that can model temporal progress of online learners and evaluate their mastery of course knowledge. Current implementation of BKT is mostly based on single machine, which leads to slow execution performance during its Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm for parameter fitting. Although there are a few parallel implementations for EM algorithm, they don't support automatic initial BKT parameter tuning to ensure the correct convergence of the EM iteration. Therefore, this paper presents a new parallel BKT open source tool based on the Spark computational framework with the method of automatic tuning of initial parameters. This tool improves traditional knowledge tracing systems using a parallel EM algorithm with the capabilty of automatically choosing initial parameters.

Existing KT methods often rely on students' learning interactions to trace their knowledge states by predicting future performance on the given questions. While deep learning-based KT models have achieved improved predictive performance compared with traditional KT models, they often lack interpretability into the captured knowledge states. Furthermore, previous works generally neglect the multiple semantic information contained in knowledge states and sparse learning interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel model named CAKT that couples contrastive learning with attention networks for interpretable knowledge tracing. Specifically, we use three attention-based encoders to model three dynamic factors of the Item Response Theory (IRT) model, based on designed learning sequences. Then, we identify two key properties related to the knowledge states and learning interactions: consistency and separability. We utilize contrastive learning to incorporate the semantic information of the above properties into the representations of knowledge states and learning interactions. With the training goal of contrastive learning, we can obtain more representative representations of them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent predictive performance of CAKT and the positive effects of considering the two properties. Additionally, CAKT can exhibit high interpretability for captured knowledge states.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191799","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61877051); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191799","knowledge tracing;consistency;separability;contrastive learning;attention networks;IRT","Knowledge engineering;Training;Couplings;Cognitive processes;Semantics;Neural networks;Predictive models","deep learning (artificial intelligence);intelligent tutoring systems;semantic networks","attention networks;attention-based encoders;CAKT;consistency;contrastive learning;deep learning-based KT models;intelligent tutoring systems;intelligent systems;interpretable knowledge tracing;IRT model;item response theory model;ITS;knowledge states;KT methods;learning sequences;personalized education;semantic information;separability;students learning interactions","","","","28","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the complexity of the tasks may impede the progress of novice learners. Providing adaptive feedback to learners who face difficulties requires learner modeling approaches that can identify learners' proficiencies and the difficulties they face in executing required skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes. This paper discusses a multilevel hierarchical learner modeling scheme that analyzes and captures learners' cognitive processes and problem-solving strategies along with their performance on assigned tasks in a game-based environment called UrbanSim that requires complex decision making for dealing with counterinsurgency scenarios.

That is, can we have a good overall prediction of a high stakes test, while at the same time be able to tell teachers meaningful information about fine-grained knowledge components?

For example, learners with various levels of comprehension will behave differently when faced with new questions, which indicates that individual differences affect prediction accuracy. In addition, most learners learn only part of the concept, which leads to data sparsity. However, the existing methods do not solve the data sparsity well. In this paper, we are motivated to propose a Learner Profile-based Knowledge Tracing (LPKT) model, which uses learners' unique id and the features extracted from historical interaction sequences as learners' representation to model individual differences among learners. In addition, we establish relationships between concepts and utilize related concepts to augment the concept's representation to address the data sparsity.

KT model is widely used in students learning outcome modeling. However, it does not support multiple subskills modeling, for the model works by checking the historical observations at a specific skill. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes three models using logistic regression over each step: KTLR-GS, extending guessing and slipping parameters; KTLR-LFID, introducing item difficult into the KT model while extending learning and forgetting parameters; KTLR-FP, extending both transition and emission parameters. Unlike previous methods our models discuss the efficiency of extending transition and emission parameters while relaxing the assumptions that subskills are independent. In the end we evaluate how well our models perform with comparison to LR-DBN, KT-IDEM and KT on two datasets: the open dataset ASSISTments, and one private dataset, student algebra dataset collected through our tutoring system.

With their multi-modal perception, the aptitude of an interlocutor in identifying them, through a diversity of behaviors such as face movements, gestures, speech, is a fundamental aspect as judgment and decision making are influenced by mood, feelings, which facilitates human adaptation and social integration. In a cognitive activity such as learning, communication (between learners and tutors) is one of the fundamental issues, and its quality may influence the learning. Therefore, learning process implies cognitive aspects as well as socio-emotional aspects: in real world, teaching also implies to observe the student's affective behavior in order to detect affective responses which can express interest, excitation, confusion, etc. and suggest a review of the actual interaction flow. This paper presents an intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) architecture equipped with emotional management capabilities which make it possible the capture of student emotions during learning and affective response to learners' actions. The result system called AITS (affective tutoring system) could efficiently adapt content planning, learning/tutoring strategies and even tutoring dialogues based on affective and cognitive data","","1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141729","Intelligent Tutoring Systems;Emotional Agent;Student Modeling;Tutoring Feedback","Intelligent systems;Context;Cultural differences;Face;Speech;Decision making;Mood;Humans;Education;Strategic planning","emotion recognition;intelligent tutoring systems;teaching;user modelling","affective intelligent tutoring systems;multimodal perception;teaching;affective response;emotional management;student emotion;content planning;tutoring dialogue;emotional agent;student modeling","","15","","24","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research has shown that adaptive e-learning improves the effectiveness of e-learning systems and removes the loneliness experienced by learners when they are online. Though this is the case, adaptive e-learning systems face the challenge of not only utilizing one learner characteristic to provide adaptation but also the problem of deciding which learner characteristic to model. This study was carried out in order to develop a learner model based on learning theories since learning theories do spell out on how learning occurs and therefore useful in determining which learner characteristic to model. Systematic literature review on articles dealing with adaptive e-learning was carried out. Articles were extracted from various databases and were selected using a three step process. 16 articles were selected for the final analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that, there is evidence of basing adaptive e-learning systems on learning theories and the most utilized theory is cognitivism. The learner characteristic that is majorly modelled is learning style.

In recent years, deep neural network-based approaches have been widely developed in KT and achieved promising results. More recently, several researches further boost these KT models via exploiting plentiful relationships including exercise-skill relations (E-S), the exercise similarity (E-E) as well as skill similarity (S-S). However, these relationship information are frequently absent in many real-world educational applications, and it is a labor-intensive work for human experts to label it. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing domain, we propose a novel pre-training approach, namely as SPAKT, and utilize self-supervised learning to pre-train exercise embedding representation without the need for expensive human-expert annotations in this paper. Contrary to existing pre-training methods that highly rely on manually labeling knowledge about the E-E, S-S, or E-S relationships, the core idea of the proposed SPAKT is to design three self-attention modules to model the E-S, E-E, and S-S relationships, respectively, and all of these three modules can be trained in the self-supervised setting. As a pre-training approach, our SPAKT can be effortlessly incorporated into existing deep neural network-based KT frameworks. We experimentally show that, even without using expensive annotations about the aforementioned three kinds of relationships, our model achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-arts.

As for the domain model, it is designed according to the recommendations of the differentiated pedagogy, which advocates creating multiple versions of the same learning object. Finally in order to ensure the adaptation inside the system, a Bayesian network, to match the designed learning object with the specifics of the learner profile was developed. It is also necessary to emphasize, that the major feature of the system is, its ability to correct the generated learning path in case of a failure in the evaluation phase. The learning path relevance is questioned, based on a recommendation system which enables updating the initial profile, or recommending the most relevant versions of the learning object, in case where the similarity calculation in behavior, reveals that the observed behavior in the system does not fit the initial profile description.","2327-1884","978-1-5090-0751-6","10.1109/CIST.2016.7805098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805098","","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Learning systems;Bayes methods;Electronic mail;Electronic learning;Erbium","belief networks;computer aided instruction;learning systems;recommender systems","ALS_CORR[LP;adaptive learning system;Felder-Silverman learning styles;Bayesian network;e-learning systems;learning process adaptation;learner prerequisites;differentiated pedagogy;generated learning path correction;recommendation system","","6","","13","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process the system engages in a process called model tracing. Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model the system identifies, or flags, that an error has occurred. This helps in the shorter feedback cycle for the student and help them in overcoming these shortcomings through the recommendation engine. The tutor model accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. Knowledge tracing tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The tutor system gives a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the know ledge tracing data and the skill meter are updated in real-time. The Another core feature of the tutor system is its recommendation engine which on the basis of the skill meter that is updated at the real time will find what all are the things that the student may be interested on and suggest him the path that could be more fruitful. And last the tutor system is able to builds student profiles while observing student performance throughout the interaction of the system.","","978-1-5386-1698-7","10.1109/ICIOTA.2017.8073608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8073608","SVD;Logistic Regression;ITS;CBM;CT","Engines;YouTube;Production;Analytical models;Problem-solving;Meters;Computed tomography","intelligent tutoring systems;problem solving;recommender systems","learner visual graph;learner progress tracking;feedback cycle;intelligent smart tutor system;student profiles;problem-solving process;tutor model;domain model;model tracing;recommendation engine","","9","1","14","IEEE","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A questionnaire is a practical way to gather information on learning style. There are some problems in questionnaire usage such as reluctance to answer questions, random guesses, taking too much time and invalid answers. In this paper, we have introduced the new parameters saved in Learning Management System(LMS) log files that are equivalent to learning approaches questionnaire. This research has been performed using40MSce-learning students on four different courses and in three phases(stages)at Tarbiat Modares University. The results derived from the questionnaire were acquired according to the learners' learning style in the first phase and in the second one were derived on Bayesian Network(BN) approach. The results based on log file and network help were taken in the third phase. It is mentioned that the third results had the least uncertainty range due to BN approach. Finally equivalent parameters for each question and for each learning style dimension are introduced based on some applied LMS package such as Moodle and Sakai. The main points in this research are as below: learning style extraction based on all the learners' activities in LMS (in a day, in a course and in a semester) and not only based on his/her related activities. For instance, the results show that the learner is more active and general if he/she considers his/her other class mates's profile or add/complete (in forums) during exact time to study. These results can be applied in Personalized Intelligent Tutoring System(PITS) in e-learning environment and so in designing recommender system to increase learners' and tutors' satisfaction level.","2163-6982","978-1-4673-0957-8","10.1109/ICELET.2012.6333361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6333361","Learning Approach;Learning Management Systems(LMS);personalization;learner behavior;Intelligent Tutoring System(ITS)","Bayesian methods;Least squares approximation;Electronic learning;Educational institutions;Knowledge engineering;Uncertainty;Materials","belief networks;educational institutions;human computer interaction;intelligent tutoring systems;recommender systems;user modelling","learners modeling;e-learning environment;LMS logs analysis;personalized e-learning;questionnaire usage;learning management system log files;Tarbiat Modares University;Bayesian network;learning style dimension;LMS package;Moodle;Sakai;personalized intelligent tutoring system;PITS;recommender system","","8","","16","IEEE","18 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ontology consists of learners' personal, cognitive and social information as well as information about their performance and skills.

Learning resource recommendation is one of the critical countermeasures to solve the above problem. The current recommendation of learning resources is mainly based on the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation method and content-based recommendation method, which do not fully consider learners' characteristics resulting in unsatisfactory effects. A collaborative filtering recommendation method for online learning resources is proposed based on a traditional collaborative filtering algorithm and combined with research in the learner modeling community. This method incorporates learners' characteristics and learning behaviors into recommendation calculations making the recommended learning resources better match learners' individual needs.

Deep learning-based knowledge tracing (DLKT) achieves superb performance in terms of prediction accuracy, but it lacks of explainability, which makes us hard to trust or understand models. The previous work on explaining DLKT was mainly based on gradients or attention scores, which is susceptible to spurious correlations, reducing the credibility of the explanation. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a causal explanation method based on the genetic algorithm (GA), named Genetic Causal Explainer(GCE), which constructs a causal framework to estimate the attribution of subsequence to the predictions of DLKT models, and a genetic coding system is designed. Further, A multi-strategy initialization method inspired by domain prior knowledge is proposed, and a global empirical matrix is introduced to capture the causal correlation knowledge during the search process across instances, and guiding the mutation operators.

To increase their quality using a parametric learner model is proposed. Tailoring the learning material presented to the respective parameter values may fit this material to the actual learner's needs. We use a stereotype user model. Our learner characteristics complement the IMS UP. We first represent learners by points in a learner space. Then we propose increasingly generic ways of grouping together such points to form learner types. The less generic one models learner types using convex regions in the learner space. The more generic one models learner types using characteristic functions. While the latter approach allows for more flexible learner type combination the former approach allows for convincing definition of initial learner types. Combining both approaches thus may result in a reasonable number of useful learner types.","","0-7695-2181-9","10.1109/ICALT.2004.1357440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357440","","Electronic learning;Information systems;Computer science;Mathematics;Cognitive science;Informatics;Context modeling;Human factors;Proposals","computer aided instruction","learner typing;electronic learning systems;e-learning system;knowledge acquisition;skills acquisition;parametric learner model;learning material;stereotype user model;characteristic function","","4","","14","IEEE","22 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the model, the first stage of the pre-test-practice post-test evaluation protocol is used to initialize the student model needed for adaptation. In order to keep assessment congruent with learning, the same type of activity is used in all three stages of evaluation, and the software tutor itself is used to administer all three stages of the protocol. In order to minimize time while maximizing learning, post-test is set to adapt to practice, and students are also provided feedback after pre-test activities on which they provide incorrect response. Finally, the software tutor is set up to administer the pre-test-practice-post-test protocol as one seamless integrated session with no discernible breaks between the stages. This model of deployment helps the developer evaluate the effectiveness of the software tutor, helps the student minimize time while maximizing learning and enables the instructor to obtain concept-level summary of what worked and what needs to be reviewed again in the classroom.

Effective knowledge management maintains the knowledge assets of an organization by identifying and capturing useful information in a usable form, and by supporting refinement and reuse of that information in service of the organization's goals. Concept Mapping provides a framework for making this internal knowledge explicit in a visual form that can easily be examined and shared.

It is known that grammar error detection and feedback are challenging problems in written language, however, they become much more difficult tasks in oral conversation because it is difficult for a system to judge whether an error is due to grammar or automatic speech recognition (ASR). False alarms occur when a learner correctly utters a remark, but the system gives feedback implying an error. Minimizing the false alarm rate is especially critical in education applications because it is imperative that the tutor give correct instruction to learners. Thus, to reduce the false alarm rate in grammar error detection and feedback, we apply a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) when the system provides feedback about a learner's mistake. The POMDP models uncertainty between grammar errors and ASR errors. An additional advantage of our method is that “belief states” in POMDP can be used for learner models which indicate each individual learner's grammar comprehension level.","","978-1-4799-7129-9","10.1109/SLT.2014.7078588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7078588","Dialog based computer assisted language learning;grammar error correction;learner model;POMDP;dialog system","Grammar;Error correction;Computational modeling;Natural languages;Speech;Uncertainty;Computers","computer aided instruction;decision theory;linguistics;Markov processes;natural language processing;speech recognition","grammatical error correction;learner comprehension model;oral conversation;grammar error feedback;grammar error detection;automatic speech recognition;false alarm rate;education applications;partially observable Markov decision process;ASR errors;belief states;learner models;grammar comprehension level","","1","","16","IEEE","2 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Fuzzy Logic for Adaptive Instruction in an E-learning Environment for Computer Programming","K. Chrysafiadi; M.

This approach is fully implemented and evaluated in an educational application module, called fuzzy knowledge state definer (FuzKSD). In particular, FuzKSD performs user modeling by dynamically identifying and updating a student's knowledge level of all the concepts of the domain knowledge. The operation of FuzKSD is based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) that are used to represent the dependences among the domain concepts. FuzKSD uses fuzzy sets to represent a student's knowledge level as a subset of the domain knowledge. Thus, it combines fuzzy theory with the overlay model. Moreover, it employs a novel inference mechanism that dynamically updates user stereotypes using fuzzy sets. It should be noted that the overlay model and stereotypes constitute two widely used methods for user modeling. However, they have not been combined with fuzzy sets thus far in the literature. The gain from this novel combination is significant as a student level of knowledge is represented in a more realistic way by automatically modeling the learning or forgetting process of a student with respect to the FCMs and thus the system can provide individualized adaptive advice. The application of this approach is not limited to adaptive instruction. It can also be used in other systems with changeable user states, such as e-shops, where consumers' preferences change over time and affect one another. Therefore, the particular module constitutes a novel generic fuzzy tool, which offers dynamic adaptation to users' needs and preferences of adaptive systems.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2310242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6763091","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);fuzzy sets;student model;personalization;programming","Adaptation models;Fuzzy logic;Adaptive systems;Fuzzy sets;Materials;Electronic learning;Computer languages","computer aided instruction;computer science education;fuzzy set theory;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation","fuzzy logic;adaptive instruction;e-learning environment;computer programming;Web-based education;fuzzy knowledge state definer;FuzKSD;fuzzy cognitive maps;fuzzy set theory;inference mechanism;knowledge representation","","55","","52","IEEE","11 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As an alternative to deep learning, BLS has gained extensive attention in data analytics. Unlike the existing deep structures based learning tools (such as deep neural networks), it is able to rapidly achieve incremental learning, and does not require tedious retraining to remodel the system. However, given image data modeling tasks, 1-D BLS requires a conventional vectorization operation, the dimension of input will be quite large for high resolution image. This operation may result in huge computational complexity, thereby increasing the time of model construction. To resolve this issue, a 2-D version of BLS, namely 2-D-BLS, is first proposed to fast construct randomized learner models by using matrix inputs. Specifically, the proposed method employs left and right projecting vectors to replace the usual high dimensional input weight. Moreover, the theoretical analyses on the superiority of 2-D-BLS against BLS are presented in terms of the algorithm complexity and the difference of random parameter space. Empirical results on MNIST dataset, NORB 3-D object image recognition dataset, ORL dataset, YaleB dataset, and handwritten digit dataset demonstrate that the proposed 2-D-BLS outperforms the existing extensions of BLS and state-of-the-art 2-D machine learning methods in terms of the learning efficiency, showing good potential of 2-D-BLS for image data analytics. Impact Statement—as a novel learning tool, BLS has achieved great success in many fields. Image recognition is one of the most widely used fields of artificial intelligence. But, BLS is a 1-D model, the vectorization operation is necessary to convert matrix input data into a row or a column vector. This operation will lead to “explosion of dimensionality” and increase the time of model construction when it is coming to image data analytic with 2-D input. This article first proposes a 2-D extension of BLS for high resolution image data analytic. The proposed method can not only avoid the “explosion of dimensionality,” but also construct the whole structure with matrix-inputs rapidly and dynamically. The improvement of this method is expected to provide a novel and great choice for the field of image recognition, such as face recognition, industrial inspection, behavior recognition, etc., in the future.","2691-4581","","10.1109/TAI.2021.3110500","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973306,62003293); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200086,BK20191043); Open Project Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries(grant numbers:2020-KF-21-10); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX21_2260); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9531377","Broad learning system (BLS);data analytics;incremental learning;two-dimensional (2-D)","Data models;Data analysis;Computational modeling;Learning systems;Complexity theory;Training data","computational complexity;data analysis;face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","novel learning algorithm;deep learning;learning tools;incremental learning;image data;model construction;2-D-BLS;matrix inputs;usual high dimensional input weight;NORB 3-D object image recognition dataset;learning efficiency;image data analytics;novel learning tool;matrix input data;high resolution image data analytic;matrix-inputs;two-dimensional broad learning system","","","","38","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to conventional methods, DKT has better predictive performance, but it also has some problems such as poor interpretability, and difficulties in reflecting the causal association between the learning process and test results. In this paper, a new DKT model is proposed based on an evolved Transformer structure (DKT-ETS). The encoder layer is composed of three coding networks with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, while inputs are three types of pre-processed data: process characteristic data, test label data, and answer results data. Output as three matrices of V, Q, K. The decoder layer also uses the attention mechanism, in which the input is the three matrices that come from encoder, and the output is the predicted result. By improving the structure, the new model introduces certain interpretability into the V, Q and K matrices of the attention mechanism. Thus, the causal relationship between the learning process and test results can be reflected a certain extent: the V matrix represents the characteristic information of the testee's learning process; the Q matrix reflects the knowledge point information examined by the current test item; and the K matrix represents the results of the previous tests.

"Handling Exponential State Space in a POMDP-based Intelligent Tutoring System","F. Wang","School of Computer Science University of Guelph Guelph, Ontario, Canada","2015 IIAI 4th International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics","7 Jan 2016","2015","","","67","72","An intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is a computer system developed to offer adaptive, one-to-one interactive tutoring. The main modules in an ITS include a student model and a tutoring model. The student model represents and tracks the student's knowledge and affective states, and the tutoring model decides tutoring actions based on the student's current states. Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a useful tool for building It's. It allows a system to adaptively teach a student even when the student's states are not completely observable. A core component in a POMDP is a state space that models the student's states. The space is exponential. When the number of state variables is large, the computational costs become a major barrier to applying POMDP in building It's. In our research, we develop a new technique for handling the exponential space. In this technique, the pedagogical order of subject concepts is used to partition the space into sub-spaces, and further reduce their sizes. In this paper, we first describe how POMDP can be used for building an ITS and discuss the exponential space problem. We then present our technique in the context of an experimental system. Finally, we present some experimental results.","","978-1-4799-9958-3","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2015.171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373878","Intelligent tutoring system;POMDP;state space","Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Education;Buildings;Artificial intelligence;Markov processes;Computers","intelligent tutoring systems;Markov processes;psychology","POMDP-based intelligent tutoring system;computer system;one-to-one interactive tutoring;student model;ITS;tutoring model;student knowledge;student affective states;tutoring actions;partially observable Markov decision process;state space;pedagogical order;exponential space problem;experimental system","","5","","11","IEEE","7 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Predicting Student Performance in an ITS Using Task-Driven Features","R. Chaturvedi; C. I. Ezeife","Mathematical and Computational Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; School of Computer Science, University of Windsor, Windsor, Canada","2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)","14 Sep 2017","2017","","","168","175","Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are typically designed to offer one-on-one tutoring on a subject to students in an adaptive way so that students can learn the subject at their own pace. The ability to predict student performance enables an ITS to make informed decisions towards meeting the individual needs of students. It is also useful for ITS designers to validate if students are actually able to succeed in learning the subject. Predicting student performance is a function of two complex and dynamic factors: (f1) student learning behavior and (f2) their current knowledge in the subject. Learning behavior is captured from student interaction with the ITS (e.g. time spent on an assigned task) and is stored in the form of web logs. Student knowledge in the subject is represented by the marks they score in assigned tasks and is stored in a specific component of the ITS called student model. In order to build an accurate prediction model, this raw data from student model and web logs must be engineered carefully and transformed into meaningful features. Existing systems such as LON-CAPA predict students performance using their learning behavior alone, without considering their (current) knowledge on the subject. Lack of proper feature engineering is evident from the low values of accuracy of their prediction models. This research proposes a highly accurate model that predicts student success in assigned tasks with a 96% accuracy by using features that are better informed not only about students in terms of the two factors f1 and f2 mentioned above, but also on the assigned task itself (e.g. task's difficulty level). In order to accomplish this, an Example Recommendation System (ERS) is designed with a fine-grained student model (to represent student data) and a fine-grained domain model (to represent domain resources such as tasks).","","978-1-5386-0958-3","10.1109/CIT.2017.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031470","ITS;Student model;Domain model;performance;task-driven;feature engineering;predictive mining","Feature extraction;Predictive models;Erbium;Data mining;Data models;Decision trees;Computational modeling","data structures;decision making;educational administrative data processing;intelligent tutoring systems;Internet;recommender systems;user modelling","Intelligent Tutoring Systems;student interaction;web logs;student knowledge;fine-grained student model;student learning behavior;student performance prediction;ITS;task-driven features;one-on-one tutoring;decision making;student success prediction;example recommendation system;ERS;student data representation","","6","","20","IEEE","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research aims to demonstrate that an Adaptive Learning Strategy can optimize training by drastically reducing the throughput time of the learning path, avoiding time-wasting, and maintaining a high level of learner engagement. Those goals will be reached using a learning management system platform and an adaptive learning algorithm on a modular course to build up and deliver personalized learning paths, recognizing the prior knowledge of each user.

Training efficient deep neural networks on much smaller sets of labeled samples is a challenging problem. With a small labeled set, the initial network suffers from low accuracy. Based on this error-prone network, the subsequent semi-supervised learning process will be fragile and unstable. To address this issue, we propose to introduce a look-ahead master model to identify the correct direction of model evolution to effectively guide the semi-supervised learning process of the student model. Specifically, our proposed LMCS method explores two major ideas. First, it introduces a new learned model composition structure so that we can compose a more efficient master network from student models of past iterations through a network learning process. Second, we develop a new method, called confined maximum entropy search, to discover new critical samples near the model decision boundary and provide the master model with look-ahead access to these samples to enhance its guidance capability. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LMCS method outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods, especially on small sets of labeled samples. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a very small set of 80 labeled samples, our method outperforms Google’s MixMatch method, reducing the error rate by more than 10%.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2020.3038663","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:U.S. Ignite 1647213,CPS 1646065); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9261608","Semi-supervised learning;image classification;deep learning","Semisupervised learning;Predictive models;Training;Entropy;Task analysis;Integrated circuit modeling;Data models","maximum entropy methods;neural nets;supervised learning","LMCS method;learned model composition structure;master network;student model;network learning process;model decision boundary;critical sample look-ahead;deep neural network training;error-prone network;semisupervised learning process;look-ahead master model;model evolution;labeled sample small set;confined maximum entropy search;CIFAR-10 dataset","","5","","42","IEEE","17 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The adaptive teaching pedagogy exploits interactions between learners and educator and is one of the best strategies to meet the different learning styles of individual student. The adaptive teaching creates a teaching and learning environment that improves the learning efficiency. This paper presents an online adaptive tutoring system (ATS) that is aimed at alleviating some of the problems that are faced by large class teaching. The ATS represents a knowledge domain as a concept structure and models the student with Bayesian networks.

As a result, ITSs limit the use of learner's profile in one tutoring system. We propose a learner agent concept that allows a profile to encompass multiple learning activities.

It has become clear that measuring the effectiveness of on-line tutoring, especially on low-income students, is much needed in such difficult times. This paper, which is based on observational data collected before the COVID-19 era, is targeting measuring the impact of a web-based math tutoring program, Noon Academy, on the academic achievement of low-income high school students (grades 10 to 12) in Saudi Arabia. We use a large amount of data collected in a student registration process and two Bayesian generalized linear models (GLM) to measure the tutoring causal effects. Model 1 uses a binomial logistic regression to predict the impact of enrolling in the tutoring program on the rate of passing in a number of students. Model 2 uses a multi-level Beta regression to measure the impact of the number of minutes on the total mark. Model 1 results show that giving math tutoring to higher-failing-risk students significantly improves the rate of passing by +5 %, reaching a maximum of + 17.15 % in some classes of students. Model 2 shows a significant positive impact of the number of tutoring minutes on the yearly math mark (max of 100), reaching an average of +3.52 marks for the highest number of minutes taken. The paper presents an application of a causal analysis approaches on a real-life social problem.

After a preliminary study about the adaptive features already built-in and the capabilities ready to perform a suitable student modeling, the research team extended those capabilities with a specific data model, student model and tutoring engine to perform automatic monitoring and sequencing of Learning Objects for each particular learner. The future implementation of this project is related to testing activities in order to prove the efficiency method in content and course delivery. This paper describes some best practices developed during a Tempus IV Project granted by EU.","","978-0-7695-5036-7","10.1109/ECONF.2013.60","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745564","Data Mining;Predicting;Adaptive;Learning Styles Activity locking;e-learning;learning management system;Open Source;student modeling","Adaptation models;Data mining;Least squares approximations;Adaptive systems;Data models;Educational institutions","behavioural sciences;data mining;data models;educational courses;learning management systems;public domain software;user modelling","student behavior assessment;adaptive e-learning processes;data mining;e-learning methodologies;instructional designer;open source platform;adaptivity technology;learning management system;LMS;student modeling;data model;tutoring engine;learning objects automatic monitoring;learning objects sequencing;testing activities;content delivery;course delivery;Tempus IV project","","6","","27","IEEE","20 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But publishing plain e-learning materials in this environment does not contribute significantly to student's learning unless a sound pedagogical framework is adopted behind this process. Substantial researches have been done in the area of adaptive and intelligent tutoring systems to develop Web-based intelligent learning environments (WILE) where the student's current knowledge about the subject matter is stored in a student model database and therefore the materials are presented according to the student's learning need. In most cases, contents are an intrinsic part of these kind of learning environments, and difficult to port to another environment in the case of reuse.

In the scientific literature, it seems to be of particular interest to provide educational applications and systems with “intelligence”, in order to be able to adapt either the learning material or the tutoring and learning processes to each individual student's needs. The module of student model is crucial for offering a personalized learning experience to each particular student. Student modeling has been introduced in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), but it's use has been extended to most current educational software applications that aim to be adaptive and personalized. Student modeling is able to highlight students individual needs, learning characteristics, knowledge level, errors or misconceptions etc. However, building a student model is a complex process. In this paper, a novel web service API, which creates platform-independent and technological-independent student models using the technology of web services, is presented. The presented API is called FSP Creator. Its innovative operation relies on the facts that the created student profile i) can be embedded in any educational application (web, mobile, game), regardless of the system's technological characteristics or programming language, ii) can be recognized by all the different applications that use it and call the same web services. Furthermore, the created student profile is based on fuzzy logic sets that are used by a Fuzzy Rule System incorporated in FSP Creator and used for selecting the appropriate learning material and exercises. However, each application that uses the created student profile can extend the fuzzy rule set or use its own fuzzy rule set as desired. For the description of the operations of FSP Creator, we have used three different educational applications (two games and one web-based educational application) that have used the fuzzy student profile, which has been created by the presented API.","","978-1-5386-8161-9","10.1109/IISA.2018.8633662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8633662","intelligent tutoring systems;fuzzy logic;web services;student modeling","Web services;Adaptation models;Games;Fuzzy logic;Education;Fuzzy sets;Adaptive systems","application program interfaces;expert systems;fuzzy logic;intelligent tutoring systems;Web services","fuzzy rule system;educational software applications;fuzzy students progress profile;Web service API Creator;intelligent tutoring systems;learning material;technological-independent student models;student modeling;personalized learning experience;learning processes;expert systems;intelligent systems;web-based educational application;fuzzy rule set;FSP Creator","","2","","17","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, loading, communication and processing of the original dense maps are time consuming for onboard computing platform, which calls for a more concise representation of maps to reduce the complexity but keep the performance of localization. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning paradigm to compress the 3D point cloud map. Specifically, we first find a subset of LiDAR points with high number of observations to preserve the localization performance, which is regarded as the teacher of map compression. An efficient optimization strategy is proposed to deal with the massive data in original map. With the supervision of compressed map, a student model is built by training a random forest model fed with geometric feature descriptors of each point. As a result, the student model is able to compress the map without referring to the expensive numerical optimization. Additionally, by incorporating the features, the innovative student model can be generalized to other new maps while no re-training is required. We conduct thorough experiments on multi-session dataset and KITTI dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed learning paradigm, and the comparison with other map compression methods. The final results show that the learned student model can achieve efficient map compression with comparable LiDAR based localization performance to the original map at the same time.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2019.2961120","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1309300); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1609210,61903332); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949733","LiDAR based localization;map compression;teacher-student learning paradigm","Three-dimensional displays;Laser radar;Optimization;Programming;Solid modeling;Analytical models;Image coding","feature extraction;mobile robots;optical radar;optimisation;radar receivers;random forests;robot vision;solid modelling","3D LiDAR map compression;efficient localization;resource constrained vehicles;LiDAR sensor;intelligent vehicles;outdoor scenes;original dense maps;onboard computing platform;teacher-student learning paradigm;LiDAR points;localization performance;efficient optimization strategy;random forest model;innovative student model;map compression methods;learned student model;efficient map compression;comparable LiDAR;3D point cloud map;numerical optimization;multisession dataset;KITTI dataset","","15","","43","IEEE","3 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a prior study, we have reported that students learning with LEMA showed statistically significant difference in their learning outcomes on a modeling ability based test than the control group. While we know that LEMA helped develop students modeling skills, the prior study did not address how it helped or why. In order to gain insight into this, in this study we investigate the different paths that different learners take as they interact with LEMA. Using screen capture logs of students' interaction with LEMA, we characterize the difference in behavior between students who score low and students who score high in a modeling based post test. We find that in spite of the fact that the total time spent by all students while interacting with LEMA is the same, the duration of time spent on each feature of LEMA and the action taken within, varies for high and low scorers.","","978-1-4799-6489-5","10.1109/T4E.2014.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009527","Interaction Behaviour;modeling skills;LEMA;self regulated learning","Cognition;Predictive models;Animation;Testing;Materials;Electron microscopy","computer aided instruction;statistical analysis","LEMA;learning environment for modeling abilities;ICT based tool;microscopic models;modeling based post test","","2","","39","IEEE","15 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The team leader usually plays a key role in collaborative learning. However, the existing research ignores the key characteristics of learners and constraints relevant to e-learners when identifying appropriate team leaders and compatible members. A novel collaborative optimization approach to learning team formation is proposed based on a refined learner model and the environments—classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO) model. With the proposed approach, a learner is modeled by combining 5-D characteristics (i.e., cognitive ability, leadership, sociability, learning style, and personality) and three types of constraints (e.g., conflicts, genders, and the number of members), and an assessment mechanism is designed to measure the comprehensive abilities of learners for identifying an ideal team leader and selecting the team members for a team. By innovatively introducing the role-based collaboration theory and E-CARGO model, the leader-centered learning team formation problem is formalized as a collaborative optimization problem. The mathematical model and the constraint relations are established for this problem, which is solved based on the IBM CPLEX package. Finally, a case study and experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient and feasible, in favor of improving the satisfaction degree of learners.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3224762","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62077014,71971221); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2021JJ30886); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9970248","Collaborative learning;environments–classes;agents;roles;groups;and objects (E-CARGO);learner model;learning team formation;team leader-centered","Federated learning;Optimization;Collaboration;Mathematical models;Leadership;Computational modeling;Genetic algorithms","","","","2","","","IEEE","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

One of the possible uses of games in education is as game-based assessments (GBA), using game tasks to generate evidence about skills and content knowledge that can be valuable. There are different approaches in the literature to implement the assessment machinery of these GBA, all of them having strengths and drawbacks. In this article, we propose using multivariate Elo-based learner modeling, as we believe it has a strong potential in the context of GBA for three aims: first, to simultaneously measure students competence across several knowledge components in a game; second, to predict task performance; and finally, to estimate task difficulty within the game. To do so, we present our GBA Shadowspect, which is focused on solving geometry puzzles, and we depict our implementation using data collected from several high schools across the USA. We obtain high-performing results (AUC of 0.87) and demonstrate that the model enables analysis of how each student's competency evolves after each puzzle attempt. Moreover, the model provides accurate estimations of each task's difficulty, enabling iterative improvement of the game design. This study highlights the potential that multivariate Elo-based learner modeling has within the context of GBA, sharing lessons learned, and encouraging future researchers in the field to consider this algorithm to build their assessment machinery.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2022.3203912","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:EAGER #1935450); MIT-SPAIN; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9875051","Educational technology;game-based assessment (GBA);K-12 education;knowledge inference;learning analytics","Games;Inference algorithms;Task analysis;Machinery;Behavioral sciences;Computational modeling;Context modeling","computer aided instruction;computer games","assessment machinery;game design;game-based assessment;GBA Shadowspect;multivariate Elo-based learner modeling","","3","","82","IEEE","2 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Learning an AM from 1 Million hours of audio presents unique ML and system design challenges. We present the design and evaluation of a highly scalable and resource efficient SSL system for AM. Employing the student/teacher learning paradigm, we focus on the student learning subsystem: a scalable and robust data pipeline that generates features and targets from raw audio, and an efficient model pipeline, including the distributed trainer, that builds a student model. Our evaluations show that, even without extensive hyper-parameter tuning, we obtain relative accuracy improvements in the 10 to 20% range, with higher gains in noisier conditions.

Alongside a hypothesized structure of conditional dependencies, we also propose an automatic method for refining the Bayes Net to eliminate unnecessary arcs. Reading assessment baselines that use strict pronunciation scoring alone (without other prior knowledge) achieve 0.7 correlation of their automatic scores with human assessments on the TBALL dataset. Our proposed structure significantly outperforms this baseline, and a simpler data-driven structure achieves 0.87 correlation through the use of novel features, surpassing the lower range of inter-annotator agreement. Scores estimated by this new model are also shown to exhibit the same biases along demographic lines as human listeners.

For learners engaged in self-study online distance learning, this may result in material being presented at either too high or too low cognitive levels. According to the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, this may result in either frustration or boredom among learners. This paper proposes a recommender-system-based adaptive e-learning framework for personalised teaching on e-learning platforms. The framework would assist designers, teachers and learners to identify issues they need to consider in order to address challenges of poor engagement in online distance settings, arising from a “one-size-fits-all” approach that does not recognise the role of individual differences in teaching and learning. Secondly, the framework may enable the identification of problems or obstacles that may be encountered when supporting learners in their quest to reduce frustration and boredom when using a Recommender-Based Pedagogical System (RBPS). A literature review was conducted on adaptive e-learning systems based on the ZPD theory, learner modelling, the Generic Adaptive Framework and a recommendation system model. 70 articles were selected from a database of 720 articles published between 2010 and 2017 to come up with the dimensions needed to develop such a model for the framework through deductive analysis. The research found out that the majority of the studies only consider three dimensions to an adaptive framework, that is, the learner model, the content model and the adaptation engine while the Generic Adaptation Framework proposes seven dimensions. In addition, the majority of the studies are based on the principles of macro-adaptation which provide a “static” snapshot of a learner's profile instead of dynamically adjusting the adaptation as learner variables. In the proposed adaptive framework, we identified five dimensions, including real-time dynamic adaptation and context modelling in addition to the learner model, the domain model and the pedagogical strategy.","","978-1-5386-3837-8","10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2017.8102297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8102297","Adaptive framework;educational recommender system;zone of proximal development;generic adaptation framework","Adaptive systems;Adaptation models;Electronic learning;Learning management systems;Real-time systems","cognition;distance learning;learning management systems;recommender systems;teaching","adaptive recommender-system based framework;personalised teaching;e-learning platforms;linear systems;e-learning material;self-study online distance learning;high cognitive levels;Proximal Development theory;adaptive e-learning framework;online distance settings;Pedagogical System;adaptive e-learning systems;ZPD theory;learner modelling;Generic Adaptive Framework;recommendation system model;content model;adaptation engine;Generic Adaptation Framework;learner variables;real-time dynamic adaptation;learning management systems;low cognitive levels","","17","","28","","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The learner model, implemented as a Protege ontology, is based not only on human professional experience but also on student testing results. This approach, based on the use of various IQ tests, allows reflecting in the ontology the dependencies identified due to linear regression methods, as well as other types of analysis.

Five learning behavior features were selected based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with students’ final grades. Through testing with data from the fall semester of 2020, the model attained the highest ROC-AUC value of 0.9390. Based on these models, the researchers conducted an engagement intervention that displayed learning behavior dashboards to students in the fall of 2021. During the intervention, the course platform updated the dashboards and notified students weekly. This intervention was further investigated through a randomized controlled trial. The experimental results suggested that the intervention could improve students’ learning behavior in terms of total study time, tutorial reading, and video viewing. In addition, this study used a modified dynamic key-value memory network model to depict a student's knowledge state and to calculate the probability of solving an exercise by mining numerous exercise records. Based on the predicted probability, instructors could recommend personalized exercises for each student. In the fall of 2021, the researchers also conducted a randomized controlled trial on this intervention, demonstrating that this personalized exercise recommendation could increase students’ concept mastery.

This paper enhanced the previous study and added MADAMIRA tool to analyze the Arabic text. Monitoring and modeling has been completed through the text modeling process by evaluating the student expressions within the chat session using MADAMIRA tool and machine learning. MADAMIRA tool enables the modeling process to categorize Arabic text into different categories, which makes it easier to use the levels of the used expressions and discover the importance of the chat session between two peers. The process of the student modeling using MADAMIRA and Machine learning will update the student model which gathers information about the student achievements within the AVCM.","","978-1-5386-0549-3","10.1109/EECSI.2017.8239087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8239087","Model;Chat;AVCM;Student;MADAMIRA;Text","Adaptation models;Tools;Mathematical model;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Color;Testing","computer aided instruction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;text analysis;user modelling","student model;text modeling process;Arabic text;MADAMIRA tool;Arabic language;chat session;Madamira tool;adaptive educational chat room","","1","","12","IEEE","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system constructs an individual model for each student, which holds information about his/her knowledge level and the error proneness in the curriculum being taught. This framework is used to support each student while studying the theoretical section and getting evaluated. Furthermore, we describe the error diagnosis component, which tries to intelligently elicit information about the reason of a student error and builds accurately his/her individual profile. The tutoring component incorporates the order of teaching a curriculum or how to offer hints during problem solving.

First, extracting the variables that represent a student's engagement in learning and defining the causal relationships among them can be difficult. Such variables are often implicit due to the unobservable nature of mental model. Second, identifying the evidence from student interaction log to infer a student's engagement level is also a major challenge. Such challenge stemmed mainly because students are granted the freedom to formulate and evaluate hypotheses in computer-based scientific inquiry learning environments, not all interactions can be useful to infer the student's engagement level. As such, the assumption that the frequency of interactions correlates with the level of student engagement can often be misleading. Therefore, this research work attempted to identify the variables of student engagement and to determine the Bayesian Network that can capture the causal relationships between the variables. In this study, two variations of Bayesian Network model were handcrafted with the prior probabilities learned using the interaction logs of 54 students. The predictive accuracy of proposed models were benchmarked against Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. The empirical findings showed that the Bayesian Network model with convergence arc directions outperformed other models, suggesting it is an optimal model for modeling student engagement in INQPRO.","1062-922X","978-1-4799-0652-9","10.1109/SMC.2013.501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6722254","Bayesian Networks;Student Modeling;Interactive Learning Environment","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Multimedia communication;Testing;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;belief networks;computer aided instruction;graphical user interfaces;scientific information systems","Bayesian network model;Naive Bayes;student engagement modeling;student engagement level;student interaction log;computer-based scientific inquiry learning environments","","8","","15","IEEE","27 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The development of an ITS is often criticized for being a complex and challenging process as individual students' needs change and often they do not realize that they need help. Consequently, such a system must be capable of dynamically adapting and monitoring each student, developing a model of their knowledge, skills and expertise. Based on the learner student model, an ITS must present instructional strategies in terms of both the content and the style, and provides explanations and practice problems as needed. The advances in the development of the computer technologies has facilitated the use and design of ITS. Nevertheless, ITS research progress has been impeded by the lack of modular system architectures, reusable components and sharable knowledge bases. Each new research or development effort typically starts from scratch, without a foundation on which to build. In this paper some of the actual limiting problems of the ITS are studied. The main contribution of this work is resumed in a proposed framework. The framework incorporates a knowledge base where data and knowledge related to the problem are maintained and a model related to the student, teaching and environmental issues together with pedagogical perspectives. We consider in the ITS context the agents' technology for address issues of modularity and reusability; and Case-Based Reasoning to store students' interactions and feedback with the ITS, in order to maintain past memory experiences and then derive new paths for teaching.","","1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141658","","Intelligent systems;Intelligent structures;Feedback;Education;Control systems;Virtual reality;Costs;Computerized monitoring;Impedance;Computer architecture","case-based reasoning;intelligent tutoring systems;teaching","intelligent tutoring system;case-based reasoning;learner student model;instructional strategy;student interaction;student feedback;teaching;one-on-one instruction","","1","","22","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249286","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2021R1C1C2004868); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054028","Early performance prediction;learner model;educational games;computational thinking;deep learning","Games;Predictive models;Performance evaluation;Machine learning;Adaptation models;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Education;Learning systems","computer aided instruction;computer games;data mining;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);random forests;regression analysis;support vector machines","action sequences;called GameEPM;computational thinking;cross-validated deep learning model;data mining approaches;early predictive modelling approach;educational computer games;educational game;final score;GameEPM approach models;gameplay experience;independent game dataset;modeling learners;predictive power;regression models;timely adaptive learning;traditional machine learning methods","","","","41","CCBYNCND","27 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we argue that in many circumstances, it is more useful to focus on avoiding stupidity rather than seeking optimality. To make this perspective specific and actionable, we propose a definition of stupidity, a taxonomy of undesirable behaviors of learning environments, and an overview of data-driven techniques for finding defects. The provided overview is directly applicable in the development of learning environments and also provides inspiration for novel research directions and novel applications of existing techniques.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2022.3154936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9723010","Computer-aided instruction;data-driven techniques;defects;student modeling","Taxonomy;Education;Testing;Task analysis;Software engineering;Recommender systems;Proposals","computer aided instruction;data analysis","learning process;stupidity perspective;human learning;learning environments;data-driven techniques;artificial intelligence;defect finding","","1","","80","IEEE","28 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The intelligence of a learning environment is largely attributed to its ability of adapting to a specific learner during the learning process. The adaptation depends on individual learner's knowledge of the subject to be learned, and other relevant characteristics of the learner. The knowledge and the relevant information about the learner are maintained in the learner model. A learner model can be defined as structured information about the learning process; and this structure contains some values of the learner's characteristics. This paper proposes a new learner model, which is based on the consideration of what is appropriate to the learning-by-example context. The model records five categories of information about the learner: personal data, learner's characteristics, learning state, learner's interactions with the system, and learner's knowledge.

This limits their performance on other tasks, such as representation/metric learning. To overcome this limitation, a novel probabilistic KT (PKT) method is proposed in this article. PKT is capable of transferring the knowledge into a smaller student model by keeping as much information as possible, as expressed through the teacher model. The ability of the proposed method to use different kernels for estimating the probability distribution of the teacher and student models, along with the different divergence metrics that can be used for transferring the knowledge, allows for easily adapting the proposed method to different applications. PKT outperforms several existing state-of-the-art KT techniques, while it is capable of providing new insights into KT by enabling several novel applications, as it is demonstrated through extensive experiments on several challenging data sets.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2995884","Greece and the European Union [European Social Fund (ESF)] through the Operational Programme “Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning 2014-2020” in the context of the project “Lighweight Deep Learning Models for Signal and Information Analysis”(grant numbers:MIS 5047925); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104915","Knowledge transfer (KT);lightweight deep learning (DL);metric learning;neural network distillation;representation learning","Task analysis;Knowledge engineering;Adaptation models;Data models;Neural networks;Training;Probability distribution","deep learning (artificial intelligence);image classification;image representation;probability","different divergence metrics;student models;different kernels;teacher model;PKT;detection tasks;classification;KT approaches;deep learning model;lightweight deep representation learning;probabilistic knowledge transfer","","32","","47","IEEE","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They appear in different roles; as learning objects that help acquire competencies, as assessment instruments for measuring learning success, or for practicing specific skills. However, as with any educational technology, proper handling and well-planned selection are crucial for successful teaching. Correspondingly, the requirements that tasks have to fulfill are wide-ranging: they should promote specific learning outcomes, be appropriate to address desired cognitive dimensions, and be tailored to the student to keep motivation and learning success high. To enable an on-demand, outcome-oriented, and individualized selection of tasks in adaptive learning systems, we need to formalize tasks in all dimensions. A detailed review of different models for cognitive processes, knowledge dimensions in education, tasks, and errors leads to the Y-Model, a model for formalizing tasks (in computer science). It forms the basis for an individual, competence-oriented integration of tasks in educational systems. Finally, we present the first implementation of the model.","","979-8-3503-4813-2","10.1109/GECon58119.2023.10295148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10295148","","","","","","","","29","IEEE","31 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A typical implement of Transformer is for handling text-like input sequences, such as Natural Language Process (NLP) and Knowledge Tracing (KT). Although Transformer is a strong model, it still has a number of improvements. Some state-of-the-art Deep-Learning-based models (e.g., BERT in [2], SAINT in [3], etc.) are based on Transformer.

Research suggests that knowledge is processed and represented in different ways and that students prefer to use different types of resources in distinct ways. However, building Adaptive Educational systems that adapt to different learning characteristics is not easy. Major research questions exist such as: how are the relevant learning characteristics identified, how does modelling of the learner take place and in what way should the learning environment change for users with different learning characteristics?EDUCE is one system that addresses these challenges by using Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences (MI) as the basis for dynamically modelling learning characteristics and for designing instructional material. This paper describes a research study, using EDUCE, that explores the effect of using different adaptive presentation strategies and the impact on learning performance when material is matched and mismatched with learning preferences. The results suggest that students with low levels of learning activity, and who use only a limited number of the resources available, have the most to benefit from adaptive presentation strategies and that surprisingly learning gain increases when they are provided with resources not normally preferred.","1873-7951","","10.1016/j.intcom.2005.11.009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155981","Student modelling;Learning characteristics;Learning styles;Instructional design;Multiple intelligences","","","","","20","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Each educational activity is specified through the deployed content, the skills required to tackle it, and those acquired, and is further annotated by the effort estimated for the task. The latter may change from one student to another, given the already achieved competence. A suitable weighting of the robustness (certainty) of student's skills, stored in SK, and their combination are used to verify the inclusion of a learning activity in the student's ZPD. With respect to our previous work, the algorithm for the calculation of the ZPD of the individual student has been optimized, by enhancing the certainty weighting policy, and a graphical display of the ZPD has been added. Thanks to the latter, the student can get a clear vision of the learning paths that he/she can presently tackle.

Traditional supervised VAD systems obtain frame-level labels from an ASR pipeline by using, e.g., a Hidden Markov model. These ASR models are commonly trained on clean and fully transcribed data, limiting VAD systems to be trained on clean or synthetically noised datasets. Therefore, a major challenge for supervised VAD systems is their generalization towards noisy, real-world data. This work proposes a data-driven teacher-student approach for VAD, which utilizes vast and unconstrained audio data for training. Unlike previous approaches, only weak labels during teacher training are required, enabling the utilization of any real-world, potentially noisy dataset. Our approach firstly trains a teacher model on a source dataset (Audioset) using clip-level supervision. After training, the teacher provides frame-level guidance to a student model on an unlabeled, target dataset. A multitude of student models trained on mid- to large-sized datasets are investigated (Audioset, Voxceleb, NIST SRE). Our approach is then respectively evaluated on clean, artificially noised, and real-world data. We observe significant performance gains in artificially noised and real-world scenarios.

The data over several years are used to determine four clusters of expert, good, average and bad skill level. The advantage of the proposed approach is in its capability to adjust the levels over time based on the new data received each year.

Mainstream methods suffer from the data scarcity of novel classes with insufficient intra-class variations, which makes the trained model biased to base classes. Actually, there are massive unlabeled novel instances in the base dataset and their adequate utilization will enhance the discriminability of model to novel classes. This paper proposes a semi-supervised few-shot object detection method, which utilizes a teacher model and a pre-trained few-shot object detector to guide the learning of a student model through adaptive pseudo labeling. In particular, a class-adaptive threshold filtering (CATF) strategy is designed to deal with the class-imbalance problem of pseudo labels. And for each novel class, the threshold to select valuable pseudo labels is determined by quantile statistics of the confidence score distribution of pseudo labels. Furthermore, the pre-trained detector and the teacher model are associated with the preliminary CATF and in-depth CATF, respectively, and then the pseudo labels from the two-stream CATF are fused to provide supervisions. In this way, the knowledge of these two models is exploited, which improves the quality of pseudo labels. Under these supervisions, the student model is trained and the teacher model is correspondingly updated through parameters sharing, thus forming a positive feedback to improve the performance of both models. Besides, an attention module is integrated to the teacher and student models to enhance the feature representation of novel instances.

Therefore, adaptive learning path recommendation is considered to be an effective means to solve the above problems in online learning. In this paper, we propose a learning path generation algorithm based on network embedding and learning effects. First, we use the network embedding to learn the user's expression in order to judge the learner's similarity. Then we generate an adaptive learning path for current learners based on the similarity between all historical learners and current learners and the learning effects of historical learners. The experimental results show that the average grade of the learners using our recommended learning path has been greatly improved.

Currently, an e-learning system which is complemented by metacognitive scaffolding has been developed. The scaffolding includes a recommendation system given by a virtual pedagogical agent. However, an academic satisfaction evaluation on the system reveals that the recommendation is less helpful. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for providing a better recommendation. Two types of recommendations are aimed, including recommendation for the definition of learning goal/sub-goal and learning strategy. Goal/sub-goal recommendation is generated by identifying students' level of prior knowledge by using text classification algorithm. On the other hand, the strategy-use recommendation is generated by modeling the fitness of previously used learning strategy using fuzzy inference system and analyzing students' interaction log with the learning strategy. Implementation of the proposed scheme produces a prototype of the recommendation system. An A/B testing is conducted to compare previous and newer recommendation systems. The test shows that most of the users prefer to use the improved recommendation system.","","978-1-5386-5813-0","10.1109/ICSTC.2018.8528664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8528664","recommendation;metacognitive scaffolding;student modeling;fuzzy inference system;algorithm learning","Electronic learning;Text categorization;Fuzzy logic;Adaptation models;Classification algorithms;Prototypes;Tools","computer aided instruction;fuzzy reasoning;information retrieval;pattern classification;recommender systems;text analysis","learning strategy;adaptive metacognitive scaffolding;self-regulated learning;e-learning system;virtual pedagogical agent;fuzzy inference system;recommendation system;recommendation improvement;pedagogical support;goal recommendation;learning goal;student prior knowledge level identification;text classification algorithm;strategy-use recommendation;student interaction log analysis","","3","","37","IEEE","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address the problem, automated evaluation methods and systems for the models have been reported. Generally, they take an expected answer and the learner's model as inputs, and determine whether the model includes the necessary elements in the answer or not. However, they only consider the names of the elements to determine corresponding pairs of the elements in the answer and the learner's model. It is insufficient to evaluate the models in the similar manner to the teachers. Therefore, we propose an automated evaluation method of conceptual data models considering the similarities of attribute sets of the concepts.

Then the target domain adaptively learns from the source domain. Specifically, there is a balance between the learning by the target domain itself and the instruction from the source domain. That is, when the guidance from the source domain is helpful for learning, the learning of target classifier emphasizes the instruction of source knowledge, and considers its own knowledge more, otherwise.

However, existing works ignore the impact of learning transfer on knowledge tracing and only track knowledge proficiency. Knowledge proficiency alone cannot fully reflect students' knowledge mastery levels. A student's knowledge structure (the similarities and differences within knowledge concepts) and abstract principle mastery level (common attributes among knowledge concepts, such as learning methods) also need to be tracked. To this end, we propose a novel multilevel Knowledge Tracing model with Learning Transfer (KTLT) to track students' knowledge mastery levels. First, we clarify the relationships among abstract principles, knowledge structure, and knowledge proficiency by utilizing the learning transfer theory in educational psychology. Then, we associate each problem with a knowledge vector in which each element represents an explicit knowledge concept by leveraging educational priors (i.e., a Q-matrix). Correspondingly, each student is represented as a knowledge vector (knowledge proficiency) and an abstract principle vector (abstract principle mastery). Given a student's knowledge and abstract principle vector over time, we use the learning and forgetting curve as priors to capture the student's knowledge proficiency and abstract principle mastery level over time. Furthermore, we embed the knowledge concept by using a student's abstract principle mastery level and obtain a personalized knowledge relevance matrix (a student's knowledge structure) by calculating the cosine similarity among the knowledge embedding results. Finally, we design a probabilistic matrix factorization framework by combining student and problem priors for tracking a student's knowledge mastery.

In this work, we propose a unified and effective semi-supervised learning framework called Mix-Teaching that can be applied to most monocular 3D object detectors. Based on the idea of decomposition and recombination, unlabelled samples are firstly decomposed into collections of image patches with high-quality predictions and collections of background images containing no objects. The student model is then trained on the mixed images containing dense instances with high-quality pseudo-labels generated by the recombination operation. In addition, we propose an uncertainty-based filter to distinguish high-quality pseudo-labels from noisy predictions during the decomposition process. As results in KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks, Mix-Teaching consistently improves MonoFlex and GUPNet by significant margins under various labeling ratios. Our method achieves around +6.34%  $AP_{3D}$  improvement against the GUPNet on the validation set when using only 10% labelled data. Using the full training set and the additional 38K raw images from KITTI, it can further improve the MonoFlex by +4.65% absolute improvement on  $AP_{3D}$  for car detection, reaching 18.54%  $AP_{3D}$ , which ranks the 1st place among all monocular based methods on the KITTI test leaderboard.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2023.3270728","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0204300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62273198,U1964203); China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M691780); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10108965","Semi-supervised learning;3D object detection;autonomous driving","Three-dimensional displays;Object detection;Training;Semisupervised learning;Noise measurement;Detectors;Databases","","","","2","","73","IEEE","26 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, Bijective soft set algorithm is used in classifying students learning style based on Felder Silverman learning style model. The discernible matrix parameter reduction was used to generate attributes reducts, whereby rules were generated from these reducts.

This system is a dialogue-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that allows the tutor and student with mixed-initiative and natural language to ask each other questions concerning the basic computer knowledge in the Computer Basics course. CQACD is based on constructivist principles and encourages the learner to construct knowledge rather than merely receiving knowledge, which has the following characteristics: (a) this system employs a domain ontology with rich semantic relationships to model the basic computer knowledge and build up a concept-centric knowledge model, (b) uses a limited number of 80 input templates with description logics to acquire the intention of questions posed by students, (c) a textual entailment algorithm with semantic technologies is proposed to match the input template and assess the student’s contribution to improve the flexibility of the system, and (d) an ontology-driven dialogue management mechanism is proposed, which can quickly form the conversational content and conversational sequence. The experimental results show that CQACD can replace the teachers’ tutoring in large classes and can promote the learning of poor students in large classes better than teachers can. The paper reveals that the domain ontology with rich semantic relationships plays an important role in the Concept Question Answer System (CQAS).

In particular, working memory capacity plays an important role in learning process, because learner often have to hold information in mind while engaged in a learning activities. Having information about learners' WMC could be helpful to support them during the learning process. Khenissi et al. [1] proposed an approach based on fuzzy logic for learner's modeling while using educational games and/or e-learning system. This paper will detail the description of the mechanism proposed by Khenissi et al. [1]. Furthermore, it will describe how the system architecture will be improved by the automatic generation of the fuzzy logic components. In particular, the machine learning, web services and the model of educational games are adopted for automatically generate the components of the fuzzy logic system. The automatic generation of these components will help the expert in parameterizing them, and thus better estimation of the learner's WMC.","","978-1-4673-8749-1","10.1109/ICTA.2015.7426879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7426879","Fuzzy Logic;Machine Learning;Web Services;Games Model;Working Memory Capacity;Learner Model","Fuzzy logic;Pragmatics;Navigation;Games;Cognition;Systems architecture;Linearity","cognition;computer aided instruction;computer games;fuzzy logic;learning (artificial intelligence);Web services","learners modeling;educational games;fuzzy logic components automatic generation;machine learning;Web services;learners WMC;working memory capacity","","3","","22","IEEE","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is due to the flexibility of LMS to deliver the learning materials in various ways and approaches. However, the heterogeneous of students' behavior, the diversity of learning materials and the complexity of hyperlink for navigation are the main factors of limitation in LMS and can caused cognitive overload among students. Many literatures show that, providing an e-learning system that considers student preferences and needs can improve student performances and understanding. Therefore, this research proposed a new framework to enhance LMS to support adaptive features. The proposed enhancement of LMS is implemented in Moodle platform which includes major adaptation features based on visual and verbal dimension of Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) and the student's knowledge level. The enhanced framework is organized into three models; domain model, student model and adaptive model that need to interact together to perform adaptively in presenting the learning materials. Three multi-agent components have been added to the Moodle platform to implement the adaptation. The current Moodle repository has also been modified by creating additional fields that are necessary for adaptation.","","978-1-5090-1125-4","10.1109/ICT-ISPC.2016.7519230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7519230","adaptive;leraning management system;Moodle;learning style;knowledge level;agent","Navigation;Adaptation models;Education","cognition;learning management systems","student performance improvement;student understanding improvement;adaptive features;Moodie platform;visual dimension;verbal dimension;Felder-Silverman learning style model;FSLSM;student knowledge level;domain model;student model;adaptive model;multiagent components;student needs;student preferences;student cognitive overload;hyperlink;heterogeneous student behavior;learning materials;LMS;e-Iearning;learning management system enhancement","","2","","16","IEEE","25 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our CUSP (Course and Unit of Study Portal) system tackles this challenge, by helping subject teachers define the curriculum of their subject, linking it to Faculty and institutional goals. The same information is available to students, enabling them to see how each subject relates to those goals. It then gives additional big-picture views of the degree for the academics responsible for the whole degree, including the ability to easily assess if a degree meets accreditation requirements. CUSP achieves this by exploiting a lightweight semantic mapping approach that gives a highly flexible and scalable way to map learning goals from multiple internal and external accrediting sources across the degree. We report its validation as used in a live university environment, across three diverse faculties, with 277 degrees and 7,810 subject sessions over a period of three years. Data from this evaluation indicates steady improvement in the documentation of the relationships between subjects, assessments, learning outcomes, and program level goals. This is driven by the reporting tools and visualizations provided by CUSP, which enable program designers and lecturers to identify parts of the curriculum that are unclear. This improved documentation of the curriculum enables more accurate and immediate quality reviews. Key contributions of this work are: a validated new approach for curriculum design that helps address the complexity of ensuring learners progressively develop generic skills; and a validated lightweight semantic mapping approach that can flexibly support visualizing the curriculum against multiple sets of learning goal frameworks.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2012.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6261335","Education courses;Accreditation;Computer science education;Education;Electronic learning;Curriculum mapping;Education courses;Accreditation;Computer science education;Education;Electronic learning;graduate attributes;Education courses;Accreditation;Computer science education;Education;Electronic learning;accreditation competencies;Education courses;Accreditation;Computer science education;Education;Electronic learning;learner model","Education courses;Accreditation;Computer science education;Education;Electronic learning","computer aided instruction;educational administrative data processing;educational courses","university curricula;multiple learning goal sets;university degree program;discipline-specific learning goal;accreditation competency;CUSP;course-and-unit of study portal system;curriculum design;lightweight semantic mapping approach","","21","","52","IEEE","6 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, educational technologies trying to become culturally-aware need to develop a socio-cultural model of their learner. In this regard, many previous projects have used a fixed set of socio-cultural criteria.

However, most of the existing anomaly detection models are statically trained on pre-recorded data from a single source, thus making multiple assumptions about the surrounding environment. As a result, their usefulness is limited to controlled scenarios. In this paper, we fuse information from live streams of audio and video data to detect anomalies in the captured environment. We train a deep learning-based teacher-student network using video, image, and audio information. The pre-trained visual network in the teacher model distills its information to the image and audio networks in the student model. Features from image and audio networks are combined and compressed using principal component analysis. Thus, the teacher-student network produces an image-audio-based light-weight joint representation of the data. The data dynamics are learned in a multivariate adaptive Gaussian mixture model. Empirical results from two audio-visual datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of joint representation over single modalities in the adaptive anomaly detection framework.

In this work, we propose FedAUX, an extension to FD, which, under the same set of assumptions, drastically improves the performance by deriving maximum utility from the unlabeled auxiliary data. FedAUX modifies the FD training procedure in two ways: First, unsupervised pre-training on the auxiliary data is performed to find a suitable model initialization for the distributed training. Second,  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -differentially private certainty scoring is used to weight the ensemble predictions on the auxiliary data according to the certainty of each client model. Experiments on large-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models demonstrate that our proposed method achieves remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art FL methods, without adding appreciable computation, communication, or privacy cost. For instance, when training ResNet8 on non-independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) subsets of CIFAR10, FedAUX raises the maximum achieved validation accuracy from 30.4% to 78.1%, further closing the gap to centralized training performance.

The challenges could be more complicated when such learning environment employs exploratory learning approach. One plausible approach to tackle the challenges is by employing data mining approach. In this study, 129 interaction logs were firstly preprocessed and subsequently transformed into structured dataset fits for mining purpose. Feature selection algorithms were performed considering that fact the dataset consists of large number of attributes. The dimension of feature set was reduced via two feature selection algorithms and elicitation of domain expert, resulting in M_ORA, M_RFE, and M_DOM, respectively. The feature sets were compared using Naïve Bayesian Networks (M_NB_DOM, M_NB_RFE, M_NB_ORA). The second phase of empirical study aimed to investigated the optimal BN model for capturing knowledge about conceptual change. To do that, a machine-learned Bayesian Network (M_LBN) was constructed and its performance was compared to M_NB_DOM.

To overcome these challenges, feature selection approach was firstly employed, using the preprocessed dataset from interaction logs of 130 students. A Bayesian Network was subsequently constructed to handle the uncertainty inherent in assessing scientific inquiry skills. Both quantitative and qualitative portions of the Bayesian Network were elicited from a domain expert.

This paper thus proposes the attributes for online monitoring model named compatible different attributes. There are 2 sets of compatible different attributes including mentee and mentor attributes. Both sets are represented in different size of matrix elements. The objective of this paper is thus to study to which extent the proposed compatible different attributes can be used for online mentoring model. The empirical study is conducted with 74 lectures and 588 students from Faculty of Information and Technology, Rajabhat Maha Sarakham University.

Existing works only consider intermediate layer feature maps between the same layers and ignore valuable information across layers, which results in the lack of appropriate cross-layer supervision in detail and the process of learning. Besides, this manner provides insufficient supervision information to supervise the learning of student, since it fails to construct a qualified teacher. In this work, we propose a Deep Cross-layer Collaborative Learning network (DCCL) for OKD, which efficiently exploits fruitful knowledge of peer student models by keeping appropriate intermediate cross-layer supervision. Specifically, each student gradually integrates its own features at different layers for feature matching, so as to effectively utilize features in low and high levels for learning more composite knowledge. Moreover, we assign a collaborative knowledge learning strategy, in which a qualified teacher is established via fusing the features of last convolution layers for enhancing high-level representation. In this way, all student models continuously transfer the rich teacher’s internal representation as well as capture its dynamic growth process, and in turn assist the learning of the fusion teacher to further supervise students. In the experiments, our proposed DCCL has shown great generalization ability with various backbone models on CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet, and also demonstrated superior performance against mainstream OKD works.

This is especially important for complex ill-structured learning tasks, i.e. tasks that are characterized by having multiple good solutions (ill-structured), allowing individual learners to follow different routes for achieving the final learning objectives, and having non-evident interactions between the different concepts in the problem domain. Conceptual modelling is an example of such complex learning task as it requires rigorous analytical skills and experience to externalize requirements into high-quality formal representations - conceptual models. These skills are very difficult to teach to novice modellers mainly due to the lack of tools that can continuously guide them in the learning process. In this talk, I will report about the use of automated feedback and simuation to guide the student's learning process for conceptual modelling. Furthermore, lessons from student modelling behaviour as observed from logging the modelling process of students will be presented. The findings include a set of typical modeling and validation patterns that can be used to improve teaching guidance for domain modeling courses. From a scientific viewpoint, the outcomes of the work can be inspirational outside of the area of domain modeling as learning event data is becoming readily available through virtual learning environments and other information systems.","2151-1357","978-1-5090-5476-3","10.1109/RCIS.2017.7956512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7956512","","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Tools;Information systems;Business","computer aided instruction;educational courses;information systems;knowledge acquisition;teaching","conceptual modelling;knowledge acquisition;skills acquisition;student learning process;teaching guidance;domain modeling courses;virtual learning environments;information systems","","1","","","IEEE","26 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, deep-learning-based recognition methods have achieved excellent performance within related fields. However, these methods usually depend on the availability of extensive training data and label information. For SSD recognition, the SSD data are often insufficient and labels are scarce, making it hard to train a supervised deep model. In this article, we proposed a novel few-shot SSD recognition method based on self-supervised contrastive learning (self-SCL), which can effectively learn data representation with unlabeled data in the pretraining stage and learn categories from a few labeled samples in the fine-tuning stage. In this method, we proposed an information-guided teacher–student (TS) pretrained model with min–max instances similarity (MMIS) regularization. In the pretraining stage, we utilized the multicrop mechanism to build a teacher encoder (TE) with multiview information and leveraged the TE to guide the student encoder (SE) with information. Meanwhile, the SE also provided the TE with “questions” during the update process, which the SE also shared updated information with the TE for further refinement. Specifically, we introduced MMIS to address the problem of ambiguity between intraclass and interclass distances in SSD data. During the fine-tuning phase, we fine-tuned the pretrained model obtained by teacher–student with min–max instance similarity (TSMMIS) with a few labeled data and tested the SSD recognition accuracy in four SSD datasets. As the experimental results indicate, our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on the four SSD datasets.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3315404","Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515010716,2021A1515011576,2017KCXTD015); Key Research Projects for Universities of Guangdong Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:2020ZDZX3031,2022ZDZX1032); Jiangmen Basic and Applied Basic Research Key Project(grant numbers:2021030103230006670); Jiangmen Science and Technology Plan Project(grant numbers:2220002000246,2022JC01021,2022JC01027); Jiangmen Major Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:202101009002624); Key Laboratory of Public Big Data in Guizhou Province(grant numbers:2019BDKFJJ015); Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macau and the Greater Bay Area International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Project(grant numbers:2021A0505030080,2021A0505060011); Research on the Scheme of Intelligent Sensing Personnel Entering and Exiting Stations(grant numbers:HX22185); Development of a Container Intelligent Panoramic Trademark Quality Inspection System Based on Machine Vision(grant numbers:HX22105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260313","Deep learning;few-shot;self-supervised contrastive learning (self-SCL);steel surface defect (SSD) recognition","Data models;Task analysis;Steel;Generative adversarial networks;Transforms;Training;Surface treatment","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);supervised learning","data representation;deep-learning-based recognition methods;economic benefits;extensive training data;fine-tuned;fine-tuning phase;fine-tuning stage;industrial metal products;information-guided teacher-student pretrained model;labeled samples;min-max instance similarity;min-max instances similarity regularization;MMIS;multiview information;pretraining stage;SE;self-supervised contrastive learning;self-supervised teacher-student model;SSD data;SSD datasets;SSD recognition accuracy;SSD recognition method;steel surface defect recognition;student encoder;supervised deep model;teacher encoder;unlabeled data","","","","53","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, feature reduction for the target knowledge-concept was first performed using Elastic Net and Random Forest algorithms, which are known to have the best performance in machine learning. Deep knowledge tracing (DKT) in the form of a dual-net, which is more efficient because of the already slimmer data, was then applied to increase the accuracy of feature selection.

This analysis mapped the design space that has been employed to communicate a learner's abilities, knowledge, and interests. It also revealed several opportunities for the inclusion of uncertainty information within visualizations of educational data. We describe how uncertainty information can be added to visualizations of educational data and illustrate these opportunities by augmenting several of the types of visualizations that are found in existing learning analytics reports. The definition of this design space, based on a survey of the literature, will enable the systematic exploration of how different design decisions affect learner trust, understanding, and decision making.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2015.2411604","Walter C.

However, it ignores the real-time tracking of students' mastery of knowledge concepts and can not provide personalized learning strategy. In order to solve this problem, we design an learning strategy model based on deep knowledge tracking. The model is divided into two steps. Firstly, the model analyzes the sequence of students' exercises through deep learning algorithm, and predicts students' mastery of knowledge concepts. Then, according to the prediction results and students' learning situation, C4.5 algorithm is used to generate learning strategy decision tree to provide students with personalized learning strategy. The model is tested on two real datasets.

Systems using data mining approaches to predict frustration have reported high accuracy, while systems that predict frustration by modeling affective states, not only predict a student's affective state but also the reason for that state. In our approach, we combine these approaches.

The teacher model is constructed by performing an exponential moving average of the student models obtained from past training steps. The master network combines the knowledge of the student and teacher models with additional access to newly discovered samples. The master and teacher models are then used to guide the training of the student network by enforcing the consistency between their predictions of unlabeled samples and evolve all models when more and more samples are discovered. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the process of discovering confident samples from the unlabeled dataset, once coupled with the master-teacher-student network evolution, can significantly improve the overall semi-supervised learning performance. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a small set of 250 labeled samples, our method achieves an error rate of 11.58%, more than 38% lower than Mean-Teacher (49.91%).

In this article, we demonstrate a backdoor threat to transfer learning tasks on both image and time-series data leveraging the knowledge of publicly accessible Teacher models, aimed at defeating three commonly adopted defenses: pruning-based, retraining-based and input pre-processing-based defenses. Specifically, ($\mathcal {A}$A) ranking-based selection mechanism to speed up the backdoor trigger generation and perturbation process while defeating pruning-based and/or retraining-based defenses.

Existing learning-based models for medical image registration consume large GPU memories and long inference time, which is difficult to be deployed in resource-limited diagnosis scenarios. To address this problem, instead of shrinking the model size as in previous works, we turn to reducing the input resolution of existing registration models and boosting their performance through knowledge distillation. Specifically, we propose a cross-resolution distillation (CRD) scheme, which is designed to train low-resolution models under the guidance of corresponding high-resolution models. Nevertheless, due to the resolution gap between features in high/low-resolution models, straightforward distillation is difficult to apply. To overcome this challenge, we first introduce a feature-shifted teacher (FST) to shift and fuse features of high/low-resolution models. Then, we exploit this teacher model to guide the learning of the low-resolution student model with distillation losses on both features and deformation fields. Finally, we only need to use the distilled student model during inference. Experimental results on four 3D medical image datasets demonstrate that the low-resolution models trained through our CRD scheme use fewer than 20% GPU memories and less than 20% inference time while achieving competitive performance compared with corresponding high-resolution models.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3178178","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62021001); University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT-2019-025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9782430","Medical image registration;knowledge distillation;deep learning","Computational modeling;Strain;Image registration;Deformable models;Three-dimensional displays;Graphics processing units;Medical diagnostic imaging","biomedical MRI;brain;image registration;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","medical image registration;high spatial resolutions;existing learning-based models;input resolution;registration models;knowledge distillation;cross-resolution distillation scheme;high-resolution models;resolution gap;straightforward distillation;teacher model;low-resolution student model;distillation losses;distilled student model;3D medical image datasets;CRD scheme use fewer than 20% GPU memories","","12","","57","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A solution space is presented with the creative development of several Architectures inspired in Leontief I/O model, multi-layers and linear programming. The architecture approach with model-oriented engineering, facilitates the 360° vision allowing us to analyze the interaction between various architecture components and specially the governability problem (all decision taking levels) for a University. It is itself a system that ensures compliance with government policies, rules and standards in a highly complex institution with intellectual assets and knowledge processes which are the typical ethos for a university. Several intelligent architectures (applications and tools) we have developed, for the analysis and solutions related to the following issues: Pedagogic Model, Academic Governability, Sustainability, Productivity (students, college authorities, and teachers), High Quality of HE including Strategic Planning and Prospective tools, HE Sector Competitiveness, including internationalization, Propaedeutic Cycles and their implications and Linking HE with media education (ME). These initiatives have been submitted to several international meetings of IEEE, ACM, ISTEC and also published as book chapters and books. The model of the student is another important achievement to have full implementation for each student individualized at the FUNDACIÓN DE EDUCACIÒN SUPERIOR SAN JOSÉ, FESSANJOSE, and both student self-control and his/her regulatory board. The architecture enables an iterative and dynamically cognitive development which is rich in personal information analysis for the improvement of the Pedagogic Model, the decision making of both student and teacher productivity. The Linear Programming with Leontief Input Output model focuses on organizational governance with its impact on university financial sustainability, knowledge generation and organizational learning to quality, productivity and competitiveness.

Previous works solve this problem by introducing useful knowledge. It is found that the interaction between question and answer (QA-interaction) is also a kind of knowledge which could help extract answer accurately. This research develops a knowledge distillation framework for biomedical factoid question answering, in which a teacher model as the knowledge source of QA-interaction is designed to enhance the student model. In addition, to further alleviate the problem of limited-scale dataset, a novel adversarial knowledge distillation technique is proposed to robustly distill the knowledge from teacher model to student model by constructing perturbed examples as additional training data. By forcing the student model to mimic the predicted distributions of teacher model on both original examples and perturbed examples, the knowledge of QA-interaction can be learned by student model.

However, the existing methods are mainly based on laboratory analysis and with significant time delays, which makes the closed-loop control of f-CaO content impossible. In this paper, a multisource data ensemble learning-based soft sensor model is developed for online estimation of clinker f-CaO content. To build such a soft sensor model, input flame images, process variables, and the corresponding output f-CaO content data for a rotary cement kiln were collected from No. 2 rotary kiln at Jiuganghongda Cement Plant which produces 2000 tonnes of clinker per day. The raw data were preprocessed to distinguish the flame image regions of interest (ROI) and remove process variable outliers. Three types of flame image ROI features, i.e., color, global configuration, and local configuration features, were then extracted without segmentation. Further, a kernel partial least square technique was applied for extracting the compressed score matrix features from the concatenated flame image features and filtered process variables to avoid high-dimensional, nonlinear, and correlated problems. Feed-forward neural networks with random weights were employed as base learners in our proposed ensemble modeling framework, which aims to enhance the model's reliability and prediction performance. A total of 157 flame images, the associated process variable data, and the experimentally measured f-CaO content data were used in our experiments. A comparative study on the f-CaO content estimator built by various feature compressed techniques and learner models and robustness analysis were carried out.

The advantage of knowledge tracking is that it can better organize and adjust students' learning plans, provide personalized guidance, and thus achieve the purpose of artificial intelligence-assisted education. However, existing methods, for instance, Convolutional Knowledge Tracing(CKT), lacking consideration of graph structure and multi-variate time-series prediction, result in poor prediction accuracy. Inspired by recent successes of the graph neural network (GNN), we present a novel Multi-Variate Graph Knowledge Tracking (MVGKT) framework to address these limitations. Specifically, a multi-variate time-series knowledge tracking system based on spatio-temporal GNN is designed to model student learning trajectories in different spatial and temporal dimensions and capture both temporal dependencies and inter-student correlations. MVGKT incorporates a Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) attentive mechanism and graph Fourier transform, discrete Fourier transform, and graph convolution network to increase the predictive accuracy of the student performances. Additionally, we design a question difficulty extraction system to obtain information on the difficulty of the questions and thus enhance the data features. Numerous experiments on the ASSISTments dataset have demonstrated that MVGKT is superior to existing knowledge-tracking methods on four metrics and has shown that our approach can enhance the predictive accuracy of student performance.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2023.3301011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10202591","Educational data mining;graph neural network;knowledge concept;knowledge tracing","Knowledge engineering;Graph neural networks;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Data mining;Data models;Trajectory","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This research work employed Bayesian Networks as an attempt to tackle the challenges. Three Bayesian Network models of conceptual change were proposed and integrated into INQPRO, a educational program developed in this research work. The first model has only nodes of conceptual change, while the second and the third model have nodes of affect component.

However, the relationship between these factors has been overlooked in previous research. To address this gap, we propose a new weakly supervised learning framework for knowledge distillation in video classification that is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the student model. Our approach leverages the concept of substage-based learning to distill knowledge based on the combination of student substages and the correlation of corresponding substages. We also employ the progressive cascade training method to address the accuracy loss caused by the large capacity gap between the teacher and the student. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-label optimization strategy to improve the initial data label. To optimize the loss functions of different distillation substages during the training process, we introduce a new loss method based on feature distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on both real and simulated data sets, demonstrating that our proposed approach outperforms existing distillation methods in terms of knowledge distillation for video classification tasks. Our proposed substage-based distillation approach has the potential to inform future research on label-efficient learning for video data.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2023.3294977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182291","Knowledge distillation;weakly supervised learning;teacher-student architecture;substage learning process;video classification;label-efficient learning","Training;Uncertainty;Correlation;Generators;Data models;Task analysis;Computational modeling","","","","","","","IEEE","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The proposed method starts with our unified conditional model– a vision language BERT model that can perform zero-shot conditional generation. Given different conditions, the unified conditional model can generate captions, dense captions, and even questions. We use the labeled image data to train a teacher model and use the trained model to generate pseudo captions on unlabeled image data. We then combine the labeled data and pseudo labeled data to train a student model. The process is iterated by putting the student model as a new teacher.

This results in teacher understanding about each student’s learning preferences and behavior, which exhibits, for instance, students’ learning styles and affective states. On the other hand, identification of learning styles and affective states in web-based learning environments is quite challenging. The existing approaches for the identification of learning styles such as questionnaire is not without limitations. Similarly, affective states identification approaches mentioned in the literature indicate several shortcomings. This paper proposes an automatic approach for the identification of learning styles and affective states in web-based Learning Management Systems (LMSs). The unique feature of this approach is that it is generic in nature. Using this approach, the students learning styles and affective states are calculated automatically from their learning preferences and behavior within a course. Evaluation of this approach was performed by following a study with 81 students. The results of the study were then compared with the learning styles and affective states questionnaires, which demonstrate that the suggested approach is more appropriate for the identification of learning styles and affective states. Therefore, using this approach, a tool (AsLim) has been developed and can be used by the teachers for the identification of learning styles and affective states of their students.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2937178","COMSATS Institute of Information Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812729","Learning management systems (LMSs);learning styles;affective states;adaptivity;personalization","Hidden Markov models;Adaptation models;Data models;Learning management systems;Task analysis;Adaptive systems","computer aided instruction;Internet","learning preferences;traditional learning environments;affective states identification approaches;automatic student modelling;learning style detection;Web based learning management systems;student learning styles;LMSs;AsLim","","5","","62","CCBY","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To utilize the unlabeled data, our method encourages consistent predictions of the network-in-training for the same input under different perturbations. With the semisupervised segmentation tasks, we introduce a transformation-consistent strategy in the self-ensembling model to enhance the regularization effect for pixel-level predictions. To further improve the regularization effects, we extend the transformation in a more generalized form including scaling and optimize the consistency loss with a teacher model, which is an averaging of the student model weights. We extensively validated the proposed semisupervised method on three typical yet challenging medical image segmentation tasks: 1) skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images in the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2017 data set; 2) optic disk (OD) segmentation from fundus images in the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE) data set; and 3) liver segmentation from volumetric CT scans in the Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) data set.

This research examines the effectiveness of using synthetic data for training academic performance prediction models, and the challenges and limitations of using the proposed data sharing method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, we generate synthetic data from a private dataset, and distribute it to the participants of a data challenge to train prediction models. Participants submitted their models as docker containers for evaluation and ranking on holdout synthetic data. A post-hoc analysis was conducted on the top 10 participant’s models by comparing the evaluation of their performance on synthetic and private validation datasets. Several models trained on synthetic data were found to perform significantly poorer when applied to the non-synthetic private dataset. The main contribution of this research is to understand the challenges and limitations of applying predictive models trained on synthetic data in real-world situations.

This work introduces the Olympia architecture, which is based on a previous architecture that combines VLs and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). In addition, Olympia enables the combination of serious games with ITSs, resulting in an educational game virtual laboratory (GVL). The GVL provides affective feedback through sound, a more engaging look-and-feel and defines student actions through the game mechanics module. Olympia was tested in a case study on teaching linear momentum in an undergraduate Physics course. For the first evaluation, a VL and a GVL were implemented. The results showed that students were motivated and learned in a similar way with both the GVL and VL environments. Later, several additions were integrated in both environments: the probabilistic student model was improved, tutorial videos were added, and the feedback was refined. For the second evaluation the results suggest that using the GVL resulted in higher learning gains than using VL.","2377-634X","978-1-4244-4715-2","10.1109/FIE.2009.5350630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5350630","Active simulators;Educational Games;Teaching Physics;Virtual Laboratories;Olympia Architecture","Education;Physics;Power system modeling;Laboratories;Artificial intelligence;Testing;Intelligent systems;Feedback;Computational modeling;Human computer interaction","artificial intelligence;computer games;educational aids;intelligent tutoring systems;linear momentum;physics computing;physics education;teaching;virtual reality","physics teaching;artificial intelligence techniques;student motivation;student knowledge;student understanding;Olympia architecture;intelligent tutoring systems;serious games;educational game virtual laboratory;GVL;game mechanics module;linear momentum;undergraduate Physics course;probabilistic student model;tutorial videos","","9","","18","IEEE","8 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a strategy to respond to students' frustration by offering motivational messages that address different causes of frustration. Based on attribution theory, these messages are created to praise the student's effort, attribute the results to the identified cause, show sympathy for failure or obtain feedback from the students. We implemented our approach in three schools where students interacted with the ITS. Data from 188 students from the three schools collected across two weeks was used for our analysis. The results suggest that the frustration instances reduced significantly statistically (p <; 0:05), due to the motivational messages.

Finally, we use the bilinear matching scheme in the hidden space to calculate the similarity between the students' ability and the exercises, and finally directly predict the learner's performance at the exercise level at the next moment.

Alloy is one such language used for modeling systems early in the development process. Little work has been done to study the styles and techniques commonly used in Alloy models. We present the first static analysis study of Alloy models. We investigate research questions that examine a large corpus of 1,652 Alloy models. To evaluate these research questions, we create a methodology that leverages the power of ANTLR pattern matching and the query language XPath. Our research questions are split into two categories depending on their purpose. The Model Characteristics category aims to identify what language constructs are used commonly.

However, deploying such large models on resource-constrained devices or embedded systems is challenging due to their high computational cost. Efforts such as model partition, pruning, or quantization have been used at the expense of accuracy loss. Knowledge distillation is a technique that transfers model knowledge from a well-trained model (teacher) to a smaller and shallow model (student). Instead of using a learning model on the cloud, we can deploy distilled models on various edge devices, significantly reducing the computational cost, memory usage and prolonging the battery lifetime. In this work, we propose a novel neuron manifold distillation (NMD) method, where the student models imitate the teacher's output distribution and learn the feature geometry of the teacher model. In addition, to further improve the cloud-based learning system reliability, we propose a confident prediction mechanism to calibrate the model predictions. We conduct experiments with different distillation configurations over multiple datasets.

In fact, there exists two main issues which should be well addressed: data imbalance between high and low action-frequency videos, and inferior detection of short actions in high-action-frequency videos. To address the above issues, we propose an effective framework by adapting to the variability of action frequency, namely Action Frequency Adaptive Network (AFAN), which can be flexibly built upon any temporal action proposal generation method. AFAN consists of two modules: Learning From Experts (LFE) and Fine-Grained Processing (FGP). The LFE first trains a series of action proposal generators on different subsets of imbalanced data as experts and then teaches a unified student model via knowledge distillation. To better detect short actions, FGP first finds out high-action-frequency videos and then performs fine-grained detection. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets (ActivityNet-1.3, HACS, THUMOS14 and FineAction) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed AFAN, especially for high-action-frequency videos.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2023.3295090","Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10183357","Temporal action proposal generation;expert learning;fine-gained detection;action frequency","Proposals;Task analysis;Data models;Time-frequency analysis;Representation learning;Predictive models;Information science","","","","","","","IEEE","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It is the only way to gain a better understanding of the knowledge and abilities of the learners, especially in a collaborative learning environment. The learner must pay special attention to interactions and real-world context when selecting collaborative situations and activities. As a result, it is critical to ensure that assessment methods and techniques are adapted so that the learning process is better suited to each group of learners, with their unique learning style, background, needs, previous experiences, and most importantly, context. This paper addressed two major issues in the development of a personalized formative assessment system that will be used to assess the knowledge, skills, and competencies of individual and group learners in an online collaborative learning environment. One approach is to design an adaptive assessment path that helps learners achieve specific learning goals based on previous learner performance, level, and context. The other is to make a personalized recommendation using a Context-Aware Recommender System (CARS), which monitors group formation while performing collaborative assessment activities. To formalize and well define our proposed system, we suggest a semantic web approach using ontologies and eLearning standards, CMI5 to describe the proposed assessment path, and IEEE PAPI for the learner model, all of which allow data reusability and interoperability.","2161-5330","979-8-3503-1008-5","10.1109/AICCSA56895.2022.10017682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10017682","Context-Aware Recommender System;adaptation;formative assessment;collaborative eLearning;ontology","Semantic Web;Electronic learning;Federated learning;Collaboration;Ontologies;Data models;Standards","computer aided instruction;groupware;ontologies (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;semantic Web;teaching","adaptive assessment path;assessment methods;collaborative assessment activities;collaborative online environment;collaborative situations;context-aware personalized formative assessment;Context-Aware Recommender System;critical component;group formation;individual group learners;learner model;online collaborative learning environment;personalized formative assessment system;personalized recommendation;previous experiences;previous learner performance;real-world context;specific learning goals;teaching-learning process;unique learning style","","1","","26","IEEE","20 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EFDLS consists of a central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components: a feature-based student–teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. For each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its teacher’s hidden layers to its student’s hidden layers via knowledge distillation, where the teacher and student have identical network structures. For each connected user, its student model’s hidden layers’ weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the server, with the least square distance (LSD) used to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected user such that the user’s and its partner’s weights are the closest among all the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user’s and its partner’s weights to these two users which then load the received weights to their teachers’ hidden layers. Experimental results show that compared with a number of state-of-the-art federated learning (FL) algorithms, our proposed EFDLS wins 20 out of 44 standard UCR2018 datasets and achieves the highest mean accuracy (70.14%) on these datasets. In particular, compared with a single-task baseline, EFDLS obtains 32/4/8 regarding “win”/“tie”/“lose” and results in an improvement of approximately 4% in terms of mean accuracy.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3201203","Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2022NSFSC0568); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172342); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9865987","Data mining;deep learning;federated learning (FL);knowledge distillation;time series classification (TSC)","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Servers;Multitasking;Time series analysis;Instruments","Bayes methods;education;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;query processing;time series","connected user;server exchanges;received weights;federated learning algorithms;efficient federated distillation learning system;multitask time series classification;central server;multiple mobile users;different TSC tasks;feature-based student-teacher framework;FBST framework transfers knowledge;knowledge distillation;student model;EFDLS server;DBWM scheme;distance-based weights matching scheme;least square distance;LSD;FL;UCR2018 datasets","","25","","61","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose of this analysis is to identify the concepts of domain that are most asked on the Web and to keep them into the learner's model as concepts not well mastered. We hypothesize that all concepts sought on the web via the search engine can be considered as knowledge poorly or badly acquired by learners and deserve thus more attention and consideration both by the tutor for the pedagogical monitoring of learners on these concepts and from the designer of course, to restructure and more enrich the educational content which articulates these concepts identified beforehand in this analysis.","","978-1-4799-4233-6","10.1109/INTECH.2014.6927773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927773","e-Learning;Search engine;track;Semantic indexing;Learner model","Ontologies;Semantics;Search engines;Electronic learning;Indexing;Semantic Web;Vocabulary","computer aided instruction;Internet;query processing;search engines","learner profile;semantic analysis;Web querying;learning systems;domain ontology;search engine","","","","19","IEEE","20 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing DG techniques can be subsumed under two broad categories, i.e., domain-invariant representation learning and domain manipulation. Nevertheless, it is extremely difficult to explicitly augment or generate the unseen target data. And when source domain variety increases, developing a domain-invariant model by simply aligning more domain-specific information becomes more challenging. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for domain generalization, named Knowledge Distillation based Domain-invariant Representation Learning (KDDRL), that learns domain-invariant representation while encouraging the model to maintain domain-specific features, which recently turned out to be effective for domain generalization. To this end, our method incorporates multiple auxiliary student models and one student leader model to perform a two-stage distillation. In the first-stage distillation, each domain-specific auxiliary student treats the ensemble of other auxiliary students' predictions as a target, which helps to excavate the domain-invariant representation. Also, we present an error removal module to prevent the transfer of faulty information by eliminating incorrect predictions compared to the true labels. In the second-stage distillation, the student leader model with domain-specific features combines the domain-invariant representation learned from the group of auxiliary students to make the final prediction. Extensive experiments and in-depth analysis on popular DG benchmark datasets demonstrate that our KDDRL significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2023.3263549","Major Technological Innovation Project of Hangzhou(grant numbers:2022AIZD0147); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LZ22F020012); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020TQ0293); Postdoctor Research from Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:ZJ2021028); Major Scientific Research Project of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2020ND8AD01); Japanese Ministry for Education, Science, Culture and Sports(grant numbers:20KK0234,21H03470,20K21821); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10093034","Domain generalization;knowledge distillation;domain invariant representation","Predictive models;Training;Representation learning;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Data models;Adaptation models","","","","1","","","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This behavior goes unnoticed or it is only estimated in the traditional web usage mining, where it is supposed that the user opens only one page at a time. However, if we could record the parallel browsing behavior, we could better understand the user's activity, goals and improve learner model employed for personalization. The paths through resources (including spawning new tabs and switching between them) of many learners also express relevance between these resources and this can be leveraged in applications such as recommendation to other learners browsing similar learning objects.

Comparing several different resource recommendation algorithms, it can be seen from the experimental data that when the similarity threshold is the same, the accuracy of the collaborative filtering method is the maximum among the three comparison methods, and the recall rate is the minimum. The average absolute error of the four algorithms can reach the minimum value when the similarity threshold is 0.3-0.4.

The model describes lifelong learning as a set of choices over which students may gradually gain control. These areas of learning autonomy include four question categories: why is learning necessary, what should one learn, how should learning occur, and how well is learning achieved. Instructors may create policies in these four areas that produce low or high degrees of learning autonomy.

This metric had been used in the application experiment in 13 programming courses, and about 1,700 sets of data was collected. From these data, the learners' model, characteristics of the change of motivation, and ways of improving teaching materials had been clarified. However, these study results were obtained after the terms, when the programming courses were over, and thus did not contribute much to the ongoing programming education. For this reason, in this research, the methods for predicting the change of learners' motivation were studied so that the learners who may need support could be identified. The idea came from the experiment the authors conducted, in which the motivation of learners was analyzed by plotting the motivation scores of each factor in the ARCS model as a 3D graph. As a result, a decreasing tendency of motivation was observed when the distribution of the plot widened. After studying the tendency in detail, it was thought to be due to the influence of the variance of sub-level category scores. In the proposed method, the motivation of each learner is assessed in each lesson using the ARCS assessment metric. If variance of the motivation scores of a learner in a lesson is above a certain threshold value AND if mean of the scores has not decreased from the previous lesson, then the learner is identified as a candidate of learner who needs support at that lesson. In the application experiment, a programming course with 9 lessons was offered and 9 learners attended all the 9 lessons. In the experiment, 7 cases had been identified as the candidates of learners who need support, and out of those 7 cases, a decrease of motivation to less than average was observed in 5 cases.","2377-634X","978-1-4799-3922-0","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044221","Programming education;Motivation;ARCS motivation model;Prediction","Programming profession;Measurement;Educational institutions;Manganese;Materials","computer science education;educational courses;programming","learner motivation;programming education;noncomputing major;ARCS assessment metric;programming course","","3","","21","IEEE","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this respect, they could be exploited to render educational content more motivating and attractive. Especially, adventure games have positive effects towards students due to their novel environment. Furthermore, adaptive educational games can offer a motivating environment reinforced with a personalised learning experience. However, there are only few educational adventure games that encompass adaptive features or their adaptivity is very limited. This paper describes an educational adventure game for learning computer programming. A student modelling component based on fuzzy logic is used to create a profile for every student and provide individualized help. The game incorporates many adaptive characteristics such as providing help through agents whenever needed. However, it's main feature is the ability to extend the scenario depending on the player's weaknesses. In this way, the game aims to motivate and engage the student by providing new screens and riddles and lengthening the total necessary time to finish it. A preliminary evaluation took place during a summer school organized by University of Piraeus and its results about the game were very encouraging.","","978-1-5386-3731-9","10.1109/IISA.2017.8316453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8316453","","Games;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Fuzzy logic;Tools;Computer architecture;Databases","computer aided instruction;computer games","adaptivity;educational adventure game;computer games;educational content;adventure games;adaptive educational games;student;adaptive characteristics;adaptive features","","11","","14","IEEE","15 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It involves different and sometimes uncorrelated sub-tasks: building a student model to define her needs, defining tools and procedures to perform tests, understanding students' replies to system prompts, defining suitable procedures to evaluate the correctness of students' replies, and strategies to improve students' abilities after the assessment session.In this work we present an improvement of our system, TutorJ, with particular attention to the assessment phase. Many tutoring systems offer only a limited set of assessment options like multiple-choice questions,fill-in-the-blanks tests or other types of predefined replies obtained through graphical widgets (radio-buttons, text-areas). This limited set of solutions makes interaction poor and unable to satisfy the users' needs. Our interest is to enrich interaction with dialog in natural language. In this respect, the assessment problem is strictly connected to natural language understanding. The preliminary step is indeed to understand questions and replies of the student.We have reviewed the system design in the framework of a cognitive architecture with the aim to reach a double result: the reduction of the effort for the construction of the knowledge base and the improvement of the system capabilities in the assessment process. To this aim a new common semantic space has been defined and implemented.

After the raw footage is captured, a new speech track is either synthesized using text-to-speech or selected based on voice similarity from a database of clean speeches. Voice conversion is then applied to match the new speech to the original voice. Time markers extracted from the original and new speech track are used to re-sample the video track for lip synchronization. We use an adaptive re-sampling strategy to minimize motion jitter, and apply bilinear and optical-flow based interpolation to ensure the image quality.

In this article, we take a first step towards mitigating one of the most advanced misclassification attacks in transfer learning. We design a distilled differentiator via activation-based network pruning to enervate the attack transferability while retaining accuracy. We adopt an ensemble structure from variant differentiators to improve the defence robustness. To avoid the bloated ensemble size during inference, we propose a two-phase defence, in which inference from the Student model is first performed to narrow down the candidate differentiators to be assembled, and later only a small, fixed number of them can be chosen to validate clean or reject adversarial inputs effectively. Our comprehensive evaluations on both large and small image recognition tasks confirm that the Student models with our defence of only 5 differentiators are immune to over 90% of the adversarial inputs with an accuracy loss of less than 10%. Our comparison also demonstrates that our design outperforms prior problematic defences.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3144988","Monash-Data61 collaborative research project(grant numbers:Data61 CRP43); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CityU 11217819,N_CityU139/21,R6021-20F); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9693248","Deep neural network;defence against adversarial examples;transfer learning;pre-trained model","Transfer learning;Task analysis;Mathematical models;Training;Computational modeling;Data models;Perturbation methods","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","activation-based network pruning;advanced misclassification attacks;attack transferability;bloated ensemble size;comprehensive evaluations;distilled differentiator;ensemble structure;image recognition tasks;Student model;Teacher model;transfer learning systems;two-phase defence","","1","","46","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, access to information requires the use of web tools for information retrieval (IR). Many methods from traditional IR were extended to structured documents. On the other hand, approaches have been proposed to regard specifically semantics in structured documents by using external semantic resources while collecting original documents on which it is necessary to provide semantic similarity measures in order to perform comparisons between concepts. Most previous approaches did not take into account the relations between concepts and are not tailored to the specific needs of learners. In this paper a semantic IR system of structured educational documents is proposed and adapted to the needs and preferences of the learner. This approach is based on a representation of the nodes of the document's tree and of the query through the semantic vectors of those concepts.

Many existing efforts tend to learn a common semantic representation embedding space in which items of different modalities can be directly compared, wherein the positive global representations of video-text pairs are pulled close while the negative ones are pushed apart via pair-wise ranking loss. However, such a vanilla loss would unfortunately yield ambiguous feature embeddings for texts of different videos, causing inaccurate cross-modal matching and unreliable retrievals. Toward this end, we propose a multimodal contrastive knowledge distillation method for instance video-text retrieval, called MCKD, by adaptively using the general knowledge of self-supervised model (teacher) to calibrate mixed boundaries. Specifically, the teacher model is tailored for robust (less-ambiguous) visual-text joint semantic space by maximizing mutual information of co-occurred modalities during multimodal contrastive learning. This robust and structural inter-instance knowledge is then distilled, with the help of explicit discrimination loss, to a student model for improved matching performance. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark video-text datasets (MSR-VTT, TGIF, VATEX, and Youtube2Text) demonstrate that our MCKD can achieve at most 8.8%, 6.4%, 5.9%, and 5.3% improvement in text-to-video performance by the  $\text{R}\text{@}1$  metric, compared with 14 SoTA baselines.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2023.3257193","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072465,62172155,62102425,62201014); Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2022RC3061,2021RC2071); Postgraduate Research and Innovation Project of Hunan Province(grant numbers:CX20210080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10068529","Cross-modal retrieval;contrastive learning;knowledge distillation","Semantics;Videos;Reliability;Task analysis;Electronic mail;Correlation;Annotations","feature extraction;image representation;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;object recognition;supervised learning;text analysis;video signal processing","ambiguous feature embeddings;co-occurred modalities;common semantic representation embedding space;cross-modal retrieval;different videos;existing efforts;explicit discrimination loss;flexible bi-directional;general knowledge;inaccurate cross-modal matching;instance video-text retrieval;multimodal contrastive knowledge distillation method;multimodal contrastive learning;negative ones;pair-wise ranking loss;positive global representations;public benchmark video-text datasets;robust inter-instance knowledge;self-supervised model;structural inter-instance knowledge;teacher model;text-to-video performance;unreliable retrievals;vanilla loss;video-text pairs;visual-text joint semantic space;Youtube2Text","","","","51","IEEE","14 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Teaching SPM is a challenging task, mainly because it lays great emphasis on theory and offers few practical exercises. Furthermore, as yet few teaching approaches have aimed at teaching SPM by introducing innovative features, such as games. The use of games has mainly been focused on other areas of software engineering, for example software project management. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper describes a formal experiment carried out to assess the learning effectiveness of a serious game (DesigMPS), designed to support the teaching of SPM, and to compare game-based learning with a project-based learning method. In the DesigMPS game, the student models a software process from an SPI perspective, based on the Brazilian SPI model (MPS.BR). The results indicate that playing the game can have a positive learning effect and results in a greater degree of learning effectiveness than does the project-based learning instructional method.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2015.2411573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7072571","Project-based learning;serious game;software engineering education;software process modeling","Software;Games;Software engineering;Training;Computational modeling;Software measurement","computer aided instruction;serious games (computing);software process improvement","serious game;software process modeling;SPM;software engineering;software process improvement;software project management;game-based learning;project-based learning method;DesigMPS game;Brazilian SPI model","","20","","44","IEEE","30 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most previous studies concentrated on guiding the student network to learn the same representations on the normality, neglecting the different behaviors of the abnormality. This leads to a high probability of false detection of subtle defects. To address such an issue, we propose to push representations on abnormal areas of the teacher and student network as far as possible while pulling representations on normal areas as close as possible. Based on this idea, we design an efficient teacher-student model for anomaly detection and localization, which maximizes pixel-wise discrepancies for anomalous regions approximated by data augmentation and simultaneously minimizes discrepancies for pixel-wise normal regions between these two networks. The explicit differential knowledge distillation enlarges the margin between normal representations and abnormal ones in favour of discriminating them. Then, the appropriate small student network is not only efficient, but more importantly, helps inhibit the generalization ability of anomalous patterns when learning normal patterns, facilitating the precise decision boundary. The experimental results on the MVTec AD, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance than current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Especially, For the MVTec AD dataset with high resolution images, we achieve 98.1 AUROC% and 93.6 AUPRO% in anomaly localization, outperforming knowledge distillation based SOTA methods by 1.1 AUROC% and 1.5 AUPRO% with a lightweight model.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3218587","National Natural Science Foundation Program of China(grant numbers:U1909207,U21B2029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9940966","Unsupervised learning;knowledge distillation;anomaly detection;anomaly segmentation","Anomaly detection;Feature extraction;Training;Image reconstruction;Artificial neural networks;Task analysis;Location awareness","data augmentation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);supervised learning;unsupervised learning","abnormal areas;abnormal ones;anomalous regions;anomaly localization;efficient teacher-student model;efficient unsupervised anomaly detection;explicit differential knowledge distillation;false detection;minimizes discrepancies;normal areas;normal patterns;normal representations;normality;pixel-wise discrepancies;pixel-wise normal regions;pull & push;student network;subtle defects;subtle unknown defect regions;unsupervised setting","","2","","66","IEEE","7 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the former strategy ignores other students’ information, while the latter increases the computational complexity during deployment. In this article, we propose a novel method for online knowledge distillation, termed feature fusion and self-distillation (FFSD), which comprises two key components: FFSD, toward solving the above problems in a unified framework. Different from previous works, where all students are treated equally, the proposed FFSD splits them into a leader student set and a common student set. Then, the feature fusion module converts the concatenation of feature maps from all common students into a fused feature map. The fused representation is used to assist the learning of the leader student. To enable the leader student to absorb more diverse information, we design an enhancement strategy to increase the diversity among students. Besides, a self-distillation module is adopted to convert the feature map of deeper layers into a shallower one. Then, the shallower layers are encouraged to mimic the transformed feature maps of the deeper layers, which helps the students to generalize better. After training, we simply adopt the leader student, which achieves superior performance, over the common students, without increasing the storage or inference cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our FFSD over existing works.

Existing semi-supervised solutions show great potential for solving this problem. Their key idea is constructing consistency regularization with unsupervised data augmentation from unlabeled data for model training. The perturbations for unlabeled data enable the consistency training loss, which benefits semi-supervised semantic segmentation. However, these perturbations destroy image context and introduce unnatural boundaries, which is harmful for semantic segmentation. Besides, the widely adopted semi-supervised learning framework, i.e. mean-teacher, suffers performance limitation since the student model finally converges to the teacher model. In this paper, first of all, we propose a context friendly differentiable geometric warping to conduct unsupervised data augmentation; secondly, a novel adversarial dual-student framework is proposed to improve the Mean-Teacher from the following two aspects: (1) dual student models are learned independently except for a stabilization constraint to encourage exploiting model diversities; (2) adversarial training scheme is applied to both students and the discriminators are resorted to distinguish reliable pseudo-label of unlabeled data for self-training. Effectiveness is validated via extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2012 and Cityscapes. Our solution significantly improves the performance and state-of-the-art results are achieved on both datasets. Remarkably, compared with fully supervision, our solution achieves comparable mIoU of 73.4% using only 12.5% annotated data on PASCAL VOC2012.

Although knowledge distillation (KD) is a feasible solution for compression, its requirement on the original dataset raises privacy concerns. In addition, it is common to integrate multiple pretrained models to achieve satisfactory performance. How to compress multiple models into a tiny model is challenging, especially when the original data are unavailable. To tackle this challenge, we propose a framework termed collaborative data-free knowledge distillation via multi-level feature sharing (CDFKD-MFS), which consists of a multi-header student module, an asymmetric adversarial data-free KD module, and an attention-based aggregation module. In this framework, the student model equipped with a multi-level feature-sharing structure learns from multiple teacher models and is trained together with a generator in an asymmetric adversarial manner. When some real samples are available, the attention module adaptively aggregates predictions of the student headers, which can further improve performance. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular computer visual datasets. In particular, compared with the most competitive alternative, the accuracy of the proposed framework is 1.18% higher on the CIFAR-100 dataset, 1.67% higher on the Caltech-101 dataset, and 2.99% higher on the mini-ImageNet dataset.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2022.3192663","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFC3300200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971457); Special Fund of Hubei Luojia Laboratory(grant numbers:220100014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9834142","Model Compression;Knowledge Distillation;Data-free Distillation;Multi-teacher Distillation;Attention","Generators;Knowledge engineering;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Aggregates;Predictive models;Collaboration","computer vision;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction","CDFKD-MFS;collaborative data-free knowledge distillation;multilevel feature sharing;powerful deep neural networks;resource-limited edge devices;multiple pretrained models;tiny model;multiheader student module;student model;multilevel feature-sharing structure;multiple teacher models;attention module;Caltech-101 dataset;asymmetric adversarial data-free KD module;computer visual datasets","","2","","61","IEEE","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, it is difficult to capture students' knowledge states caused by sparse interactions with exercises. Moreover, most recommendation methods are dedicated to the performance of the recommendation w.r.t. accuracy, disregarding the students' learning ability. We introduce a new framework called contrastive personalized exercise recommendation with reinforcement learning (RCL4ER) to tackle these issues. Our framework augments the standard recommendation model with an output layer of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The reinforcement allows the supervised layer to focus on specific rewards, acting as a regularizer. The self-supervised layer provides a powerful signal for parameter updating. Three data augmentation methods are used to provide additional data, which are leveraged to conduct contrastive learning and incorporated into reinforcement learning as supplementary information. In addition, we adopt a trained deep knowledge tracing model to capture the changes in students' knowledge states, so as to establish a dynamic reward mechanism. Experiments of our framework based on four recommendation backbones on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our RCL4ER, which successfully promotes students' capacity and improves recommendation performance.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2023.3326449","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072182,92270119,61977058); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:23ZR1418500); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10290979","Contrastive learning;knowledge tracing;q-learning;recommendation;reinforcement learning","Reinforcement learning;Education;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Focusing;Recommender systems;History","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we demonstrate that the kullback-leibler loss inhibits the neuronal responses in the opposite gradient direction, which injures the student model's potential during distilling. To address this problem, we introduce a principled dual-stage distillation scheme to rejuvenate all inhibited neurons at the neuronal level. In the first stage, we detect all the neurons in the student model during the standard distillation period and divide them into two parts according to their responses. In the second stage, we propose three strategies to resuscitate the neurons differently, which allows us to exploit the full potential of the student model. Through the experiments in various aspects of knowledge distillation, it is verified that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches.

It consists of three essential components: focal classification distillation (FCD), focal regression distillation (FRD) and focal feature distillation (FFD). Taking the low-resolution data as input, the student model can learn discriminative features and produce more accurate results with the assistance of the teacher model trained on high-resolution data. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of Focal Distillation. Evaluated on the KITTI validation set, a typical SECOND model trained with Focal Distillation outperformed its non-distilled counterpart by 3.37%, 7.52%, 11.35% mAP on the category Car, Pedestrian, and Cyclist of moderate level, respectively.

We designed a mechanism to explore the correlation between exercises-knowledge concepts and knowledge concepts-knowledge concepts, and dynamically analyze the cognitive difficulty of exercises.

The CLP Prolog module supported the grading process helping eventually to get a complete set of grades although the teacher had actually graded only a (substantial indeed) part of them. Here we try and tackle the problem of grading open answers by an alternative approach, using peer-assessment in a social collaborative e-learning setting, mediated by the teacher through a simple Bayesian-networks-based model, that allows managing student models (based on the same finite-domain variables as above) and producing again automated evaluations of those answers that have not been graded by the teacher.

Much of engineering education has focused on designing courses and curriculum to maximize both cognitive and, increasingly, non-cognitive learning outcomes. The role of affective outcomes, such as feelings or values, have been comparatively under-studied in the engineering context [1]. This despite the fact that there is promising research in both educational psychology and computer science that links positive affect with enhanced learning outcomes [2], [3].To design a study based on affect, an engineering professor partnered with an advanced undergraduate psychology student to develop a model for capturing and applying affective outcomes in applied engineering courses. To measure affect, we collected weekly surveys of the students’ affective responses to both the mode of delivery and nature of the content using categories such as boredom, surprise, and confidence, each of which have been identified as potentially significant by other researchers. We then integrated the students’ responses into a predictive linear recursion model, which was, in turn, used to make curricular decisions periodically throughout the semester. In other words, the students’ affective responses were used to influence the content and the delivery of the course as it was being taught.Our findings suggest that using this predictive model to optimize affective responses could be used as the basis of responsive course design and the enhancement of student learning outcomes. The study has implications for the further study of the role of affective outcomes in engineering education; as well as the advancement of co-created (with students) models of instructional and curricular design that incorporate affective variables.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274279","Affect;Linear Recursion Model;STEM;Optimization","Spirals;Solid modeling;Predictive models;Psychology;Statistics;Sociology;STEM","cognition;computer science education;educational courses;engineering education;further education;optimisation;psychology;STEM","affect effect;student emotions;engineering technology courses;optimization method;innovative practice full paper;noncognitive learning outcomes;engineering education;curriculum;educational psychology;computer science;engineering professor;advanced undergraduate psychology student;affective outcomes;applied engineering courses;affective responses;responsive course design;student learning outcomes;instructional design;curricular design;affective variables;cognitive learning outcomes;science technology engineering and math;STEM;predictive linear recursion model;curricular decisions","","2","","37","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this challenging environment, several students overcome these issues and graduate, which indicates that some protection structures allow students to face challenging situations and be successful in their studies. Current research studied the relationships between academic performance, self-efficacy, causal attributions, personal characteristics, and life at university, with a group of 30 students. Models were studied by combining the different variables and aspects evaluated in the research, and the findings show relationship between academic performance and: 1) self-efficacy, causal attributions, and personal characteristics (such as leisure activities, living with their parents, or college accommodations) and those who attended private schools during basic education; 2 protection factors self-efficacy and causal attributions with advancing in the program and the time of enrolment in the university; and 3) the dimensions initiation and persistence, success/internality and failure/internality, indicating that those who perceive themselves as playing a major role in their academic journey tend to have better outcomes. Further results show the influence of social inequalities, particularly for those students who declared themselves brown and who conducted their basic education in public schools (which are generally of lower quality than private ones in Brazil).","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2022.3168771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9841038","Academic performance;causal attribution;engineering education;self-efficacy","Education;Faces;Psychology;Schedules;Ethics;Engineering profession;Task analysis","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;further education","causal attributions;personal characteristics;academic performance;self-efficacy;basic education;protection factors;academic journey;conference FiE 2020;undergraduate engineering programs;engineering education outlook;quantitative analysis;science dissertation;Brazil;leisure activities;college accommodations","","","","25","IEEE","26 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We designed a user experiment where different subjects had to remember a large set of images. In the meantime, we collected about 19,000 fixation points. Among other metrics, our results show a strong correlation between the relative path angles and the memorized items. It is thus possible to predict the users' memory status by analyzing their gaze data while interacting with the system, so as to provide recommendations that fits their learning curve.","2375-0197","978-1-5090-4459-7","10.1109/ICTAI.2016.0019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814579","Learner modeling;Gaze data;Eye-Tracking;Visual memory;Recall","Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Recommender systems;Visualization;Context;Memory management;Monitoring","cognition;recommender systems","recommender systems;user preference analysis;gaze features;visual memory;relative path angles;memorized items;user memory status;learning curve","","1","","33","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It may be argued that such forms of evaluation are adaptive in a per- question basis. Other, more commercial products such as on-line book resorce of Physics by Wilson Buffa (Prentice- Hall), and the Brownstone software don't offer selective assembly of quizzes and tests, resorting rather to large exam sets from which the user may encounter a variety of practice options. In the case of courses un mathematics and physics, it would be desirable to have the questions themselves be adaptive, that is, that the values and variables used in formulas within the exam be adaptive based on student and domain models.

To address this challenge, we investigate the effect of knowledge distillation (KD) on training neural networks for the face photo–sketch synthesis task and propose an effective KD model to improve the performance of synthetic images. In particular, we utilize a teacher network trained on a large amount of data in a related task to separately learn knowledge of the face photo and knowledge of the face sketch and simultaneously transfer this knowledge to two student networks designed for the face photo–sketch synthesis task. In addition to assimilating the knowledge from the teacher network, the two student networks can mutually transfer their own knowledge to further enhance their learning. To further enhance the perception quality of the synthetic image, we propose a KD+ model that combines GANs with KD. The generator can produce images with more realistic textures and less noise under the guide of knowledge.

Some of these translate directly into the mathematics classroom. With our materials, students get data from a variety of sources, data that arise in real-world phenomena. Students find functions to model the data; these appear as curves on scatter plots. Through this, students learn about the phenomena, and also about the mathematics behind the functions. This is neither complicated nor particularly new [see, e.g., Hestenes, D. (1987) Toward a Modeling Theory of Physics Instruction. American Journal of Physics, 55, 440–445 and Wells, M. Hestenes, D. and Swackhamer, G. (1995) A Modeling Method for high school physics instruction. American Journal of Physics, 63, 606–619.]. Thus this paper focuses on some details. How do students model the data? In what ways do students find these tasks challenging? And why don't we already do this more commonly? The observations we make in this paper are conjectures based on observations of students in classrooms in the San Francisco, California area; documenting them more thoroughly is the object of ongoing research. In this paper, we will discuss how students do modeling, describe the search for meaning in the parameters (for example, the meaning of slope), and describe some of the problems students seem to have coordinating the data and the models.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hri025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148784","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Towards effective learning outcome assessment, the exam script generation problem has attracted many attentions recently. But the research in this field is still in its early stage. Two essential issues have been ignored largely by existing solutions. First, given a course, it is unknown yet how to generate an quality exam script which concurrently has (i) the proper difficulty level, (ii) the coverage of essential knowledge points, (iii) the capability to distinguish academic performances between students, and (iv) the student scores in normal distribution. Second, while frequently encountered in practice, it is unknown so far how to generate a pair of high quality exam scripts which are equivalent in assessment (i.e., the student scores are comparable by taking either of them) but have significantly different sets of questions. To fill the gap, this paper proposes ExamGAN (Exam Script Generative Adversarial Network) to generate high quality exam scripts, and then extends ExamGAN to T-ExamGAN (Twin-ExamGAN) to generate a pair of high quality exam scripts.

Recent ABSA research focuses on utilizing multi-task learning (MTL) to achieve less computational costs and better performance. However, there are certain limits in MTL-based ABSA. For example, unbalanced labels and sub-task learning difficulties may result in the biases that some labels and sub-tasks are overfitting, while the others are underfitting. To address these issues, inspired by neuro-symbolic learning systems, we propose a meta-based self-training method with a meta-weighter (MSM). We believe that a generalizable model can be achieved by appropriate symbolic representation selection (in-domain knowledge) and effective learning control (regulation) in a neural system. Thus, MSM trains a teacher model to generate in-domain knowledge (e.g., unlabeled data selection and pseudo-label generation), where the generated pseudo-labels are used by a student model for supervised learning.

This paper seeks to offer a deep learning system that automatically mines the statistic laws of material and directs stock market operations using bottom neural network models and empirical mode deconstruction. This basic pattern was discovered but then dissected using the data's typical timeframe. Data from stock market transactions were examined, PSO-optimized, and forecasted. Prediction efficiency can be increased by merging non stationary and exponential financial time series. If a specific trust level is met, the deep learning prediction, which is based on the study of enormous amounts of financial trade data, can determine the future trend and financial markets pricing. The empirical findings demonstrate the superior predictive efficiency of the EMD-based deep learner models.The aim of this paper is to conduct an empirical evaluation regarding stock market forecasting using extreme learning machine.

However, performance of such ASR system is inefficient for children speech, due to numerous acoustic variability in children speech and scarcity of resources. In this paper, we propose to use the unlabeled data extensively to develop ASR system for low resourced children speech. State-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 is the baseline ASR technique used here. The baseline’s performance is further enhanced with the intuition of Noisy Student Teacher (NST) learning. The proposed technique is not only limited to introducing the use of soft labels (i.e., word-level transcription) of unlabeled data, but also adapts the learning of teacher model or preceding student model, which results in reduction of the redundant training significantly. To that effect, a detailed analysis is reported in this paper, as there is a difference in teacher and student learning. In ASR experiments, character-level tokenization was used and hence, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss was used for fine-tuning. Due to computational limitations, experiments are performed with approximately 12 hours of training, and 5 hours of development and test data was used from standard My Science Tutor (MyST) corpus. The baseline wav2vec 2.0 achieves 34% WER, while relatively 10% of performance was improved using the proposed approach. Further, the analysis of performance loss and effect of language model is discussed in details.","2474-915X","978-1-6654-8250-9","10.1109/SPCOM55316.2022.9840763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9840763","","Training;Adaptation models;Conferences;Self-supervised learning;Signal processing;Data models;Tokenization","computer based training;natural language processing;speech recognition;supervised learning;teacher training","self supervised learning;children ASR;automatic speech recognition;high resource languages;adult speech;acoustic variability;low resourced children speech;wav2vec 2.0;word-level transcription;teacher model;student learning;character-level tokenization;baseline wav2vec;noisy student teacher training;noisy student teacher learning;NST;soft labels;connectionist temporal classification loss;CTC;standard My Science Tutor corpus;MyST corpus","","","","25","IEEE","1 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning styles and multiple intelligence theories have been widely used in student modeling to show how a student ad quires knowledge and highlights special learning abilities. Through the bringing together of these two areas of learning a picture of an individual student can be made. This information therefore becomes useful for a tutor to adapt the learning process to the student. It is therefore within this context that this study proposes an innovative method that is driven by the Kolb learning process in order to improve the intelligence percentages by bringing out in each individual those areas in which they excel, but also help in the improvement of the learning process where deficiency is detected.

Subsequently, countless great people have invested their life in exchange for this enjoyment upon Human taste buds. However, even a three-Michelin-starred chef cannot remember the detailed steps to all the dishes, and ordinary citizens do not have the time or energy to create their recipes. This paper proposes an aid system that uses neural networks to achieve accurate recipe projections to facilitate life. A deep learning system based on Decoder and Encoder is implemented using CNN and Transformer. The CNN reduces the memory cost by transforming the image to a vector, achieving faster processing. The Transformer is used to determine ingredients' presence and combine the information of existing dishes to construct an instruction. Such a network can facilitate food production and research. It is making the creation of unique dishes convenient by revolutionizing the method of recording. After the model is created, the backbone network of CNN layers are manipulated to test for the best result. Backbone network tests include ResNet50, ResNet152 without attention, ResNet152 with attention, Vgg16, and AlexNet. Out of all tested, ResNet152 is resulted with the highest iou (Intersection over Union), and without-attention is chosen as it possesses less complexity than its counterpart. Then, knowledge distillation is applied to decrease the complexity and size of the model. This process used the complex model as a trainer to the student model by basing the student training on the result of the teacher model, achieving a similar level of accuracy with a significantly lower complexity and size. This decrease in complexity increases the portable capability of the model, potentially applying into applications and websites on devices in the future without consuming much memory.","","979-8-3503-1373-4","10.1109/ICSECE58870.2023.10263583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10263583","Neural networks;Ingredient detection;Convolution&max pooling;Recipe creation;Practice developmental;Knowledge Distillation","Knowledge engineering;Training;Taste buds;Neural networks;Production;Transformers;Complexity theory","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;food products;image classification;image processing;storage management","AlexNet;CNN;decoder-encoder system;deep learning system;feature vector;food classification;food production;food recipe prediction;image transformation;ingredients;knowledge distillation;memory cost;neural network;portability;recipe projection;ResNet152;ResNet50;student model;student training;teacher model;Transformer;unique dishes;vector image;Vgg16","","","","6","IEEE","29 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies have shown that knowledge distillation approaches can effectively transfer knowledge from a high-resolution teacher model to a low-resolution student model by aligning cross-resolution representations. However, these approaches still face limitations in adapting to the situation where the recognized objects exhibit significant representation discrepancies between training and testing images. In this study, we propose a cross-resolution relational contrastive distillation approach to facilitate low-resolution object recognition. Our approach enables the student model to mimic the behavior of a well-trained teacher model which delivers high accuracy in identifying high-resolution objects. To extract sufficient knowledge, the student learning is supervised with contrastive relational distillation loss, which preserves the similarities in various relational structures in contrastive representation space. In this manner, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar low-resolution objects can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer.

Specifically, we use a parameter-optimized model as the teacher updated as the training epochs to provide additional supervision during the training process. The teacher model has the same structure as the student model, with weights inherited from the historical student model. In addition, a multiview check is introduced to filter out the outliers produced by the teacher model. Furthermore, we leverage the contextual consistency between high-level and low-level features to obtain multiscale disparity offsets, which are used to refine the disparity output incrementally by aligning disparity information at different scales.

We for the first time combine both of their advantages and propose an Adversarial Mean Teacher (AMT) framework. On the one hand, we optimize the student model with domain adversarial learning. On the other hand, we feed perturbed target images to the teacher model to generate pseudo-labels. Furthermore, to improve the quality of the pseudo-labels, we propose an Adaptive Teaching (AT) module, consisting of pseudo-label refinement and credible pseudo-label selection. Concretely, we first generate two candidate pseudo-labels from the prediction of the teacher model and obtain a refined pseudo-label by mixing them at the pixel-level. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary task of foreground-background classification to assist credible region selection and only activate supervision signals on those regions.

In this study, we statistically analyze the relationship between motion estimation accuracy and video interpolation quality of existing video frame interpolation methods, and find that only supervising the final output leads to inaccurate motion and further affects the interpolation performance. Based on this important observation, we propose a general motion distillation framework that can be widely applied to flow-based and kernel-based video frame interpolation methods. Specifically, we begin by training a teacher model, which uses the ground-truth target frame and adjacent frames to estimate motion. These motion estimates then guide the training of a student model for video frame interpolation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing performance across diverse advanced video interpolation model structures.

Adaptation is meant, in this case, with respect to the knowledge possessed by the learner and her learning styles, both evaluated prior to the course and maintained while attending the course. Knowledge and Learning styles are the components of the student model managed by the framework. Both the static, precourse, and dynamic, in-course, generation of personalized learning paths are managed through an adaptation algorithm and performed by a planner, based on Linear Temporal Logic. A first Learning Objects Sequence is produced based on the initial learner's Cognitive State and Learning Styles, as assessed through prenavigation tests. During the student's navigation, and on the basis of learning assessments, the adaptation algorithm can output a new Learning Objects Sequence to respond to changes in the student model. We report here on an extensive experimental evaluation, performed by integrating LS-Plan in an educational hypermedia, the LecompS web application, and using it to produce and deliver several personalized courses in an educational environment dedicated to Italian Neorealist Cinema.

They are the most recent development in open online distance learning. Thus, the most challenging is designing an accurate method to evaluate and provide feedbacks, especially for open questions (especially Problem Situation), since the high number of learners. To tackle this problem, MOOCs use peer assessment techniques (known as peer grading) that suffer from a lack of credibility. In this paper, we present a new method for peer assessment in the Massive Open Online Courses, in order to improve the accuracy of grading results. Our proposition is divided into three (3) steps: clustering unit, assessment and treatment of the results. The clustering unit is the task of grouping learners with similar profiles. Clustering unit aims to group learners based on the parameters stored on learners' modeling within the MOOCs. After the clustering unit, the learners are required to grade a small number of their peers' tasks as part of their own task. Afterwards, the scores are dispatched for treatments where a synthesis is given for assessment. To assess the feasibility of the proposed peer assessment, we report here the results of the tests conducted on the developed prototype.","","978-1-5090-6332-1","10.1109/ICITECH.2017.8080054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8080054","Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs);Peer assessment;Assessment;Clustering of learners;E-learning;Feedback","Education;Information technology;Computer science;Tools;Visualization;Indexes","computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses;further education","Massive Open Online Courses;clustering unit;open online distance learning;peer assessment techniques;peer grading;MOOC;higher education","","5","","21","IEEE","23 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Being local, the material used by the educational institution for instruction quickly becomes stagnated. Further, the institution tends to overlook quality materials that are available elsewhere. In addressing these key shortcomings, GLMS (a) recognizes course content in terms of its geographically distributed units (aka, learning objects), (b) associates cross-institutional instructional processes to learning objects, and (c) ensures security, privacy, and authenticity for the use of learning objects. We borrow established techniques from Grid Computing to achieve these three goals. Other benefits that we anticipate from GLMS include distributed resource sharing, heterogeneous learning objects for adaptive learning, scalability of learning objects, discovery of resources, learner modeling and security management.

In this work, we propose the knowledge distillation hashing (KDH) to deal with occluded face images. The KDH is a two-stage learning approach with teacher-student model distillation. We first train a teacher hashing network using normal face images and then the knowledge from teacher model is used to guide the optimization of the student model using occluded face images as input only. With knowledge distillation, we build a connection between imperfect face information and the optimal hash codes. Experimental results show that the KDH yields significant improvements and better retrieval performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art deep hashing retrieval methods under six different face occlusion situations.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2023.3246238","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62202175,61876066); 67th Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M672631); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10048551","Occlusion;face retrieval;knowledge distillation;hashing","Face recognition;Faces;Codes;Feature extraction;Representation learning;Convolutional neural networks;Training","","","","1","","","IEEE","17 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Over the past decades, several platforms have been proposed to support the peer assessment process. The current landscape is dominated by special-purpose, context-specific peer evaluation systems, which were designed to support a particular type of learning activity, artifact, or discipline. In this article, we propose an alternative, a generic and comprehensive peer assessment platform, called LearnEval, which is very flexible and able to accommodate a variety of pedagogical scenarios. Distinctive functionalities include: highly configurable peer assessment workflow, several automatic and manual review allocation mechanisms, initial calibration/training options for the students, complex dashboard with statistics, scores and graphical visualizations, as well as an extensive open learner model. The platform was developed in an iterative manner, with several extensions and improvements informed by the findings of the initial pilot studies. The article also reports on a practical application of LearnEval in a project-based learning scenario, with very promising results; multiple perspectives of the peer assessment process are analyzed: student behavior, peer grades validity, and perceived learning experience. Comparative results with an earlier study show increased levels of system usability, grading validity, and student satisfaction.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2022.3185423","European Social Fund; Sectorial Operational Program Human Capital; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9803240","Peer assessment system;peer grading validity;peer reviewing;project-based learning (PBL);student satisfaction;system usability","Educational technology;Usability;Iterative methods;Writing;Electronic learning;Education;Training;Quality assessment;Reviews;Engineering education;Student experiments;Learning systems","computer aided instruction;data visualisation","learning activity;highly configurable peer assessment workflow;automatic review allocation mechanisms;manual review allocation mechanisms;extensive open learner model;LearnEval peer assessment platform;valuable educational activity;learner engagement;context-specific peer evaluation systems;iterative development process;critical thinking;initial calibration-training option;complex dashboard;graphical visualizations;project-based learning scenario;student behavior;peer grades validity;perceived learning experience","","1","","42","IEEE","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, shallow networks have much noise, which can not capture this very well. To address this problem, we propose using the deepest network instruct shallow network for enhancing shallow networks. Specifically, the networks of FSD are divided into several segments, the deepest network being used as the teacher model, and all shallow networks become multiple student models by adding classifiers. Meanwhile, the distillation path between the deepest network feature and shallow network features is used to reduce the feature difference.

Humanity-based research strives for a long term research goal for supporting human learning with the primary concern on individuality, personal developmental potential, and the like, whether the student learns individually or socially. Second, we argue that in order to proceed to humanity-based research, we need to harness and revisit research on student modeling which is the central theme of the current artificial intelligence in education research.
