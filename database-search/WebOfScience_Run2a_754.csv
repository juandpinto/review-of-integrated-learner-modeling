SModel server includes a student model database and a Bayesian student modelling component. SModel provides several services to a group of agents in a CORBA platform. Users can use ViSMod, a Bayesian student modelling visualization tool, and SMV, a student modelling database viewer, to visualize and inspect distributed Bayesian student models maintained by SModel server. SModel has been tested in a multi-agent tutoring system for teaching basic Java programming. In addition, SModel server has been used to maintain and share student models in a study focussed on exploring the existence of student reflection and analysing student model accuracy using inspectable Bayesian student models.

Student modelling plays a prominent role in many intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that address problem-solving domains. However, considerably less attention has been paid to using a student model to personalize instruction in tutorial dialogue systems (TDSs)-ITSs that engage students in natural-language, conceptual discussions. This paper describes Rimac, a TDS that tightly couples student modelling with tutorial dialogues about conceptual physics. Rimac is distinct from other TDSs insofar as it dynamically builds a persistent student model that guides reactive and proactive decision making in order to provide adaptive instruction. An initial pilot study set in high school physics classrooms compared a control version of Rimac without a student model with an experimental version that implemented a poor man's student model; that is, the model was initialized using students' pretest scores but not updated further. Both low and high prior knowledge students showed significant pretest to posttest learning gains. However, high prior knowledge students who used the experimental version of Rimac learned more efficiently than high prior knowledge students who used the control version. Specifically, high prior knowledge students who used the student model driven tutor took less time to complete the intervention but learned a similar amount as students who used the control version. A subsequent study found that both high and low prior knowledge students learned more efficiently from a version of the tutor that dynamically updates its student model during dialogues than from a control version that included the static poor man's student model. We discuss future work needed to improve the performance of Rimac's student model and to integrate TDSs in the classroom.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,1560-4292,1560-4306,,,,,,,"Univ Pittsburgh, Learning Res & Dev Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USAUniv Tartu, Ctr Educ Technol, Tartu, EstoniaCarnegie Mellon Univ, Human Comp Interact Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USAEduc Testing Serv, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA",,,,2021-01-22,WOS:000604896900001,

The researchers mentioned that the next generation of e-learning is e-learning ecosystem. E-learning ecosystem has many advantages, in which, learners form groups, collaborate with each other and with educators, and content designed for interaction. E-learning ecosystem faces some issues. It applies teacher-student model, in which, fixed learning pathway is considered suitable for all learners. Consequently, learners are presented with limited personalized materials. E-learning ecosystem needs to merge the personalization's concept. Semantic web ontology based personalization of learning environment plays a leading role to build smart e-learning ecosystem.

Most of these studies focus on personalizing e-learning by providing learners with suitable learning objects, ignoring the other learning process components.

Predictions from learner models are frequently used in combination with mastery criterion decision rules to make pedagogical decisions. Important aspects of learner models, such as learning rate and item difficulty, can be estimated from prior data. A critical function of AIS is to have students practice new content once the AIS predicts that they have 'mastered' current content or learned it to some criterion. For making this prediction, individual student parameters (e.g., for learning rate) are frequently unavailable due to having no prior data about a student, and thus population-level parameters or rules-of-thumb are typically applied instead. In this paper, we will argue and demonstrate via simulation and data analysis that even in best-case scenarios, learner models assuming equal learning rates for students will inevitably lead to systematic errors that result in suboptimal pedagogical decisions for most learners. This finding leads us to conclude that systematic errors should be expected, and mechanisms to adjust predictions to account for them should be included in AIS. We introduce two solutions that can adjust for student differences online in a running system: one that tracks systemic errors of the learner model (not the student) and adjusts accordingly, and a student-level performance adaptive feature. We demonstrate these solutions' efficacy and practicality on six large educational datasets and show that these features improved model accuracy in all tested datasets.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1560-4292,1560-4306,,,,,,,"Amplify Educ Inc, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USAUniv Memphis, Inst Intelligent Syst, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",Amplify Educ Inc,,,2022-06-29,WOS:000814014700001,

There are many approaches and technologies for student modeling, but choosing the right one depends on intended functionalities of an intelligent system that the student model is going to be used in. Those functionalities often determine the kinds of information that the student model should contain. The student model used in DEPTHS is a result of combining two widely known modeling approaches, namely, stereotype and overlay modeling. The model is domain independent and can be easily applied in other learning domains as well. To keep student model update during the learning process, DEPTHS makes use of a knowledge assessment method based on fuzzy rules (i.e., a combination of production rules and fuzzy logics). The evaluation of DEPTHS performed with the aim of assessing the system's overall effectiveness and the accuracy of its student model, indicated several advantages of the DEPTHS system over the traditional approach to learning design patterns, and encouraged us to move on further with this research.

In particular, a student is first assigned to a stereotype category concerning her/ his knowledge level of the domain being taught. Then, the model of the new student is initialized by applying the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm among the students that belong to the same stereotype category with the new student. ISM has been applied in a language learning system, which has been used as a test-bed.

Half started with the one-student model and the other half with the two-student model and then switched using the same faculty. Students and faculty completed forms on the educational value of the two models (1 very poor; 2 poor; 3 average; 4 good; and 5 excellent) and identified educational preferences and recommendations.Results: We assigned educational values for the 13 procedures as follows: All faculty rated the one-student model as excellent; six members rated the two-student model as excellent, and seven as good. Students rated 50%-75% as excellent and 12%-44% as good for the two-student model, and 56%-81% as excellent and 12%-44% as good for the one-student model. Given resource constraints, all faculty and 88% of students preferred the two-student model. With no resource constraints, 75% of students and 50% of faculty chose the two-student model. All faculty and students rated both models acceptable. Overall, 81% of students and 50% of faculty rated the two-student model better. All faculty members recommended that the models be optional; 94% of students recommended that they be either optional (50%) or a two-student model (44%). Performing or assisting on each procedure twice was considered an advantage of the two-student model.Conclusions: The two-student teaching model was acceptable and generally preferred in this study. With appropriately trained faculty and students, the two-student model is feasible and should result in less animal usage and possibly wider promulgation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, the promise will not be achieved simply by AI and Machine Learning researchers developing innovative models that more accurately predict labeled data. As AI advances, modeling techniques and the models they produce are getting increasingly complex, often involving tens of thousands of parameters or more. Though strides towards interpretation of complex models are being made in core machine learning communities, it remains true in these cases of black box modeling that research teams may have little possibility to peer inside to try understand how, why, or even whether such models will work when applied beyond the data on which they were built. Rather than relying on AI expertise alone, we suggest that learning engineering teams bring interdisciplinary expertise to bear to develop explanatory learner models that provide interpretable and actionable insights in addition to accurate prediction. We describe examples that illustrate use of different kinds of data (eg, click stream and discourse data) in different course content (eg, math and writing) and toward different goals (eg, improving student models and generating actionable feedback). We recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Researchers in learning analytics and educational data mining have been successful in creating innovative models of data that optimize prediction. Some of these models produce scientific or practical insights and fewer have been put into use and demonstrated to enhance student learning. What this paper adds We provide examples of development of explanatory models of learners that not only accurately predict data but also provide scientific insights and yield practical outcomes. In particular, researchers with expertise in cognitive science and math education content use AI-based data analytics to discover previously unrecognized barriers to geometry student learning. They use model-derived insights to redesign an online tutoring system and close-the-loop by experimentally demonstrating that the new system produces better student learning than the original. Implications for practice and/or policy We define explanatory learning models and provide an articulation of a process for generating them that involves interdisciplinary teams employing human-computer interaction and learning engineering methods. Based on our experiences, we recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning.",,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,1,1,38,,,0007-1013,1467-8535,,,,,,,"Carnegie Mellon Univ, Language Technol & Human Comp Interact, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USACarnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USAMARi, Washington, DC USACarnegie Mellon, Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA USA",MARi,,,2019-08-13,WOS:000481105900001,

In order to provide the proper tutoring to a student, an IVET needs to keep and update dynamically a student model taking into account the student's behaviour in the Virtual Environment. For that purpose, the proposed student model employs a student ontology, a pedagogic diagnosis module and a Conflict Solver module. The goal of the pedagogic diagnosis module is to infer which learning objectives have been acquired or not by the student. Nevertheless, the diagnosis process can be complicated by the fact that while learning the student will not only acquire new knowledge, but he/she may also forget some previously acquired knowledge, or he/she may have some oversights that could mislead the tutor about the true state of the student's knowledge. All of these situations will lead to contradictions in the student model that must be solved so that the diagnosis can continue. Thus, our approach consists in applying diagnosis rules until a contradiction arises. At that moment, a conflict solver module is responsible of classifying and solving the contradiction. Next, the student ontology is updated according to the resolution adopted by the Conflict Solver and the diagnosis can continue. This paper mainly focuses on the design of the proper mechanisms of the student model to deal with the non monotonic nature of the pedagogic diagnosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to provide important information to researchers, educators and software developers of computer-based educational software ranging from e-learning and mobile learning systems to educational games including stand alone educational applications and intelligent tutoring systems. In addition, this paper can be used as a guide for making decisions about the techniques that should be adopted when designing a student model for an adaptive tutoring system. One significant conclusion is that the most preferred technique for representing the student's mastery of knowledge is the overlay approach. Also, stereotyping seems to be ideal for modeling students' learning styles and preferences. Furthermore, affective student modeling has had a rapid growth over the past years, while it has been noticed an increase in the adoption of fuzzy techniques and Bayesian networks in order to deal the uncertainty of student modeling.

So, the way that helps an individual to learn best is crucial for offering her/him an effective tutoring experience. As a consequence, students' preferable styles of learning should be incorporated into the student model. However, some researchers have concluded that there are individuals that have a mixture of learning styles. That is the reason for the combination of two different learning style models in the presented approach. Particularly, in this paper we present a stereotype student model that combines the Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing and Kinesthetic (VARK) learning style model and the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI). The aim of this article is to further enhance the personalization to students' needs and preferences by introducing this hybrid instrument and using the technology of stereotypes. The gain from this hybrid learning style approach is that we model two different dimensions of the way that a student prefers to learn: i) the sensory modalities of learning and ii) the way of thinking. In this way, the offered tutoring process can be more tailored to each individual student's needs, respecting the distinct pace of her/his learning.

Three factors have been identified to influence the matching accuracy of INQPRO's learner model. These factors are the structure of DDN model, the variable instantiation approach, and the weights assignment method for two consecutive Decision Networks (DNs). In this research work, a two-phase empirical study involving 107 learners and six domain experts was conducted to determine the optimal conditions for the INQPRO's dynamic learner model. The empirical results suggested each time-slice of the INQPRO's DDN should consist of a DN, and that DN should correspond to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) accessed. In light of evidence, observable variables should be instantiated to their observed states; leaving the remaining observable nodes uninstantiated. The empirical results also indicated that varying weights between two consecutive DNs could optimize the matching accuracy of INQPRO's dynamic learner model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

From literature, 44 research articles were identified from a number of digital databases published between 1997 to 2022 base on systematic literature review (SLR) method. The findings show that the majority 48% of IPT implementation focuses on knowledge and skills. While 52% articles focused on a combination of two to three student characteristics where one of the combinations is knowledge and skill. When narrow down, 25% focused on knowledge and skills with errors or misconceptions; 4% focused on knowledge and skill with cognitive features; 5% focused focus on knowledge and skill with affective features; 2% focused on knowledge and skill with motivation; and 9% based on knowledge and skill with learning style and learning preferences as students' characteristics to build their student model. Whereas 5% focused on a combination of three student characters which are knowledge and skill with cognitive and affective features and 2% focused on knowledge and skill with learning styles and learning preferences and motivation as students' characteristics to construct the tutoring system student model. To provide an appropriate tutoring system for the students, students' characteristic needs to decide for the student model before developing the tutoring system. From the findings, it can say that knowledge and skills is an essential students' characteristic used to construct the tutoring system student model.

Learner-system discussion, editing or other interaction about the learner model can allow users to contribute more directly to the modeling process to increase its accuracy, while at the same time, further facilitating reflection as they justify their viewpoints to themselves and the system. Social learning can be supported by opening learner models to peers, helping learners to gauge their relative progress, and effectively seek collaborators.

An adaptive e-learning system needs to deduce the learner model for adding personalization to instructional websites. The learner model is the perception repository about the e-content user, which can be inferred implicitly by employing meaningful semantic analysis of the text. In this research, a novel methodology is proposed to conceptually deduce the semantic learner model for personalized e-learning recommendations. Firstly, Conceptual Learner Model (CLM) is developed based on the learner's behavior and context-based text semantic representation by exploiting concepts from the ConceptNet knowledge base, with a significant association of patterns and rules. Then, Expanded Contextual Learner Model (ECLM) is developed by exploring the latent semantics in graphs to add concepts with the common-sense meanings that exceeded the named entities. The learner's knowledge graph is defined based on contextually associated concepts. Semantic relations in ConceptNet are exploited to extend learner models. The Normalized Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSO) algorithm is used to learn the importance of the relation types between the concepts. Thus, CLM and ECLM each are represented as a vector of weighted concepts in which updating is obtained automatically. The proposed recommendation system incorporates dynamic learner models to predict an appropriate e-content with the highest ranking, matching the true needs of a particular learner. Our simulation results show that the performance of ECLM is better Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) value 0.780 than other existing methods.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1540-9589,1544-5976,,,,,,,"CV Raman Global Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Bhubaneswar 752054, Odisha, India",CV Raman Global Univ,,,2022-04-29,WOS:000783753900009,

Our system was used by the students of a postgraduate program in the field of Informatics in the University of Piraeus, in order to learn how to program in the programming language C. The results of the evaluation were very encouraging. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) on the other hand are able to represent multiple skills jointly within one model. In this work, we suggest the use of DBNs for student modeling. We introduce a constrained optimization algorithm for parameter learning of such models. We extensively evaluate and interpret the prediction accuracy of our approach on five large-scale data sets of different learning domains such as mathematics, spelling learning, and physics.

Computational models that simulate learner interactions and data hold great promise for educational technology as well. Amongst others, simulated learners can be used for teacher training, for generating and evaluating hypotheses on human learning, for developing adaptive learning algorithms, for building virtual worlds in which students can practice collaboration skills with simulated pals, and for testing learning environments. This paper provides the first systematic literature review on simulated learners in the broad area of artificial intelligence in education and related fields, focusing on the decade 2010-19. We analyze the trends regarding the use of simulated learners in educational technology within this decade, the purposes for which simulated learners are being used, and how the validity of the simulated learners is assessed. We find that simulated learner models tend to represent only narrow aspects of student learning. And, surprisingly, we also find that almost half of the studies using simulated learners do not provide any evidence that their modeling addresses the most fundamental question in simulation design - is the model valid? This poses a threat to the reliability of results that are based on these models. Based on our findings, we propose that future research should focus on developing more complete simulated learner models. To validate these models, we suggest a standard and universal criterion, which is based on the lasting idea of Turing's Test.

When learning music, particularly, these two properties are indispensable. This chapter surveys suggestions made by experts in the field of AI in education today towards the incorporation of ITS tools and techniques into MOOCs. Yet, more traditional student models and tutoring modules are not without shortcomings themselves and the real challenge lies in making active models of both the tutor and the student, which can be used to predict future learning tracks and set the right challenges. Agent-based tutoring systems offer an attractive framework for building such active tutor/student models. The proposed concepts are illustrated in the domain of music composition.

An important research direction of the field is to provide students with customised learning trajectories via student modelling. Previous studies have shown that customisation of learning trajectories could effectively improve students' learning experiences and outcomes. However, training an ITS that can customise students' learning trajectories suffers from cold-start, time-consumption, human labour-intensity, and cost problems. One feasible approach is to simulate real students' behaviour trajectories through algorithms, to generate data that could be used to train the ITS. Nonetheless, implementing high-accuracy student modelling methods that effectively address these issues remains an ongoing challenge. Traditional simulation methods, in particular, encounter difficulties in ensuring the quality and diversity of the generated data, thereby limiting their capacity to provide intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) with high-fidelity and diverse training data. We thus propose Sim-GAIL, a novel student modelling method based on generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method using GAIL to address the challenge of lacking training data, resulting from the issues mentioned above. We analyse and compare the performance of Sim-GAIL with two traditional Reinforcement Learning-based and Imitation Learning-based methods using action distribution evaluation, cumulative reward evaluation, and offline-policy evaluation. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional ones on most metrics. Moreover, we apply our method to a domain plagued by the cold-start problem, knowledge tracing (KT), and the results show that our novel method could effectively improve the KT model's prediction accuracy in a cold-start scenario.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0941-0643,1433-3058,,,,,,,"Univ Durham, Dept Comp Sci, Durham, EnglandNewcastle Univ, Sch Comp, Open Lab, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England",,,,2023-10-17,WOS:001077141300010,

Such a model includes a number of psychological characteristics and study preferences that describe the learner's personality traits related to learning. During the last decades, the design methods and tools for e-learning have been designed assuming specific learner models. Therefore, in the search for a learning environment suitable for as many learner models as possible, we need tools to explore-and exploit-such models. In general, the learner's characteristics can be linked to the so-called learner's learning style (which is a part of the learner model) to provide the instructor with extensive knowledge about the learner's characterization in perceiving and processing information. Numerous learning styles have been proposed in the last decades, in some cases with overlapping characteristics with the same or different names. Thus, the heterogeneity of the learning style space makes it difficult to handle customization effectively. In this paper, we introduce a Learner's Characteristics Ontology based on creating interconnections between the different learning style model dimensions and learning styles with the relevant learner's characteristics, that: (1) helps instructors to improve and personalize the learning content; (2) can recommend learning materials to learners according to their learning characteristics and preferences; (3) can provide both instructors and learners with extensive knowledge about how they can improve their teaching and learning abilities; and (4) can improve communications and interaction between humans and computers by specifying the semantics of the learning style models' characteristics.

However, using the off-the-shelf models against fundus image datasets of different races may lead to degraded performance due to domain shift. To address the issue, this paper proposes a dual-tutor student learning network (DSLN) for multiracial glaucoma detection. The proposed DSLN consists of an inter-image tutor, an intra-image tutor, student model and backbone network, which combines the advantages of domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. The inter-image tutor uses CycleGAN for style transfer to reduce the appearance differences between labeled source domain and labeled target domain images, and transfers the learned knowledge to the student model by minimizing knowledge distillation loss. The intra-image tutor adopts the exponential moving average to leverage the unlabeled target domain and transfers the knowledge to the student model by minimizing prediction consistency loss. Moreover, the student model not only directly learns knowledge from the labeled target domain images, but also learns the intra-image knowledge and inter-image knowledge transfer by two tutors. Furthermore, the backbone integrates the context features of the local optic disc region and global fundus image via modified ResNet50. We conduct extensive experiments on three scenarios constructed from nine public fundus image datasets of three races. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed DSLN framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models and has good robustness and generalization: it can effectively overcome domain shift and accurately detect glaucoma from multi-ethnic fundus images.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0941-0643,1433-3058,,,,,,,"Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaShandong Univ Sci & Technol, Shandong Prov Key Lab Wisdom Min Informat Technol, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China",,,,2022-03-16,WOS:000765194500002,

In the work presented here, we have used the GBSM to define Bayesian Student Models (BSMs) for a concrete domain: first degree equations. In order to test the diagnosis capabilities of such BSMs, an evaluation with 152 students has been performed. Each of the 152 students took both a computerized test within PMatE and a written exam, both of them designed to measure students' knowledge in 12 concepts related to first degree equations. The written exam was graded by three experts. Then two BSMs were developed, one for the computer test and another one for the written exam. These BSMs were used to obtain estimations of student's knowledge on the same 12 concepts, and the inter-rater agreement among the different measures was computed. Results show a high degree of agreement among the scores given by the experts and also among the diagnosis provided by the BSM in the written exam and expert's average, but a low degree of agreement among the diagnosis provided by the BSM in the computer test and expert's average.

To this aim, we systematically reviewed the literature of the last three decades and found 67 articles, of which only a sample of 15 were considered. Based on the findings, we performed a narrative analysis of the studies concerning technological features of OLMs that cater to the three main aspects concerning self-regulated learning, namely, cognition, metacognition and motivation. Our analysis of the literature confirmed that these three aspects are all subject to some measure of influence. In mutually interacting, these three components support learners to reach a better understanding of their learning process. Specifically, it seems that mostly all three type of OLMs, inspectable, negotiable, and co-operative, with simple and complex graphical presentation of their learner models and capacity to colour-code and compare-alike appear optimal for augmenting cognition, metacognition, and motivation. They seemingly do so through offering a wealth of techniques pertaining to knowledge, difficulties, and misconception visualization. The results presented suggest that OLMs have a positive impact on learners' active thinking regarding their learning process. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Several educational environments have been enhanced with open learner models (OLMs) with the aim of supporting learners. OLM seems to be a potential avenue for improving higher education by supporting learners' active thinking about their learning process by enhancing self-regulated learning. Despite growing interest in OLMs, there has yet to be any effort to systematically review current research studies investigating their potential to promote self-regulated learning. What this paper adds All type of OLMs, with their varied visualization features, to some extent are useful for promoting cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational components of self-regulated learning. In mutually interacting, the three components of self-regulated learning support learners to reach a better understanding of their learning process, and thereby promoting active thinking. Implications for practice and/or policy We suggest that practitioners must first grasp the possibilities for the cultivation of self-regulated learning contained in the particular features of each OLM, and then add this insight to their own expertise in order to best integrate them for supporting students' active thinking. While a number of specific features of OLMs seem pertinent to cultivating one particular element of self-regulated learning, there remains the chance that, through the interaction of cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational tactics, these features could in fact make a more holistic and general contribution. This supports learners to move from active-in-behaviour to active-in-thinking activities in digital learning environments.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,1,22,,,0007-1013,1467-8535,,,,,,,"Univ Tartu, Ctr Educ Technol, Tartu, EstoniaTallinn Univ, Tallinn, EstoniaUniv Tartu, Inst Educ, Educ Technol, Ctr Educ Technol, Tartu, Estonia",,,,2019-09-13,WOS:000482504900019,

The development of education informatization has led to a rapid increase in the number of online learning users and an explosion in the number of learning resources, which makes learners face the dilemma of information overload and learning lost in the learning process. In the personalized learning resource recommendation system, the most critical thing is the construction of the learner model. Currently, most learner models generally have a lack of scientific focus that they have a single method of obtaining dimensions, feature attributes, and low computational complexity. These problems may lead to disagreement between the learner's learning ability and the difficulty of the recommended learning resources and may lead to the cognitive overload or disorientation of learners in the learning process. The purpose of this paper is to construct a learner model to support the above problems and to strongly support individual learning resources recommendation by learning the resource model which effectively reduces the problem of cold start and sparsity in the recommended process. In this paper, we analyze the behavioral data of learners in the learning process and extract three features of learner's cognitive ability, knowledge level, and preference for learning of learner model analysis.

To support individualised learning and support proactive scaffolding when students are struggling, game-based learning environments should be able to accurately predict student knowledge at early points in students' gameplay. Student knowledge is traditionally assessed prior to and after each student interacts with the learning environment with conventional methods, such as multiple choice content knowledge assessments. While previous student modelling approaches have leveraged machine learning to automatically infer students' knowledge, there is limited work that incorporates the fine-grained content from each question in these types of tests into student models that predict student performance at early junctures in gameplay episodes. This work investigates a predictive student modelling approach that leverages the natural language text of the post-gameplay content knowledge questions and the text of the possible answer choices for early prediction of fine-grained individual student performance in game-based learning environments. With data from a study involving 66 undergraduate students from a large public university interacting with a game-based learning environment for microbiology, Crystal Island, we investigate the accuracy and early prediction capacity of student models that use a combination of gameplay features extracted from student log files as well as distributed representations of post-test content assessment questions. The results demonstrate that by incorporating knowledge about assessment questions, early prediction models are able to outperform competing baselines that only use student game trace data with no question-related information. Furthermore, this approach achieves high generalisation, including predicting the performance of students on unseen questions. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic A distinctive characteristic of game-based learning environments is their capacity to enable fine-grained student assessment.Adaptive game-based learning environments offer individualisation based on specific student needs and should be able to assess student competencies using early prediction models of those competencies.Word embedding approaches from the field of natural language processing show great promise in the ability to encode semantic information that can be leveraged by predictive student models.What this paper adds Investigates word embeddings of assessment question content for reliable early prediction of student performance.Demonstrates the efficacy of distributed word embeddings of assessment questions when used by early prediction models compared to models that use either no assessment information or discrete representations of the questions.Demonstrates the efficacy and generalisability of word embeddings of assessment questions for predicting the performance of both new students on existing questions and existing students on new questions.Implications for practice and/or policy Word embeddings of assessment questions can enhance early prediction models of student knowledge, which can drive adaptive feedback to students who interact with game-based learning environments.Practitioners should determine if new assessment questions will be developed for their game-based learning environment, and if so, consider using our student modelling framework that incorporates early prediction models pretrained with existing student responses to previous assessment questions and is generalisable to the new assessment questions by leveraging distributed word embedding techniques.Researchers should consider the most appropriate way to encode the assessment questions in ways that early prediction models are able to infer relationships between the questions and gameplay behaviour to make accurate predictions of student competencies.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0007-1013,1467-8535,,,,,,,"North Carolina State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Raleigh, NC USAUniv Cent Florida, Sch Modeling Simulat & Training, Orlando, FL USAEduc Testing Serv, AI Res Labs, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA",,,,2023-03-02,WOS:000921645500004,

Reflection is a key component of self-regulated learning, and it is critical in effective learning. However, there is currently limited work exploring the utility of reflection for inducing accurate predictive student models. This article presents a predictive student modeling framework that leverages natural language responses to in-game reflection prompts to predict student learning outcomes in a game-based learning environment for middle school microbiology, CRYSTAL ISLAND. With data from a pair of classroom studies involving 118 middle school students, we investigate the accuracy of early prediction models that utilize features extracted from student trace data combined with word embedding-based representations (i.e., GloVe, ELMo) of student reflection responses. We evaluate the accuracy of the predictive models over time using data from incremental segments of each student's interaction with the game-based learning environment, and we compare against models that omit student reflection features.

Assessing and identifying the effects of student characteristics is important for online educational systems. Machine learning (ML) is becoming significant in utilizing learning data for student modeling, decision support systems, adaptive systems, and evaluation systems. The growing need for dynamic assessment of student characteristics in online educational systems has led to application of machine learning methods in modeling the characteristics. Being able to automatically model student characteristics during learning processes is essential for dynamic and continuous adaptation of teaching and learning to each student's needs. This paper provides a review of 8 years (from 2015 to 2022) of literature on the application of machine learning methods for automatic modeling of various student characteristics. The review found six student characteristics that can be modeled automatically and highlighted the data types, collection methods, and machine learning techniques used to model them. Researchers, educators, and online educational systems designers will benefit from this study as it could be used as a guide for decision-making when creating student models for adaptive educational systems. Such systems can detect students' needs during the learning process and adapt the learning interventions based on the detected needs. Moreover, the study revealed the progress made in the application of machine learning for automatic modeling of student characteristics and suggested new future research directions for the field. Therefore, machine learning researchers could benefit from this study as they can further advance this area by investigating new, unexplored techniques and find new ways to improve the accuracy of the created student models.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,2624-8212,,,,,,,"Univ Saskatchewan, Comp Sci Dept, Multiuser Adapt Distributed Mobile & Ubiquitous Co, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",,,,2023-02-04,WOS:000915543600001,36406472

To mimic how the teacher teaches the student, existing knowledge distillation methods mainly adapt an unidirectional knowledge transfer, where the knowledge extracted from different intermedicate layers of the teacher model is used to guide the student model. However, it turns out that the students can learn more effectively through multi-stage learning with a self-reflection in the real-world education scenario, which is nevertheless ignored by current knowledge distillation methods. Inspired by this, we devise a new knowledge distillation framework entitled multi-target knowledge distillation via student self-reflection or MTKD-SSR, which can not only enhance the teacher's ability in unfolding the knowledge to be distilled, but also improve the student's capacity of digesting the knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three target knowledge distillation mechanisms: a stage-wise channel distillation (SCD), a stage-wise response distillation (SRD), and a cross-stage review distillation (CRD), where SCD and SRD transfer feature-based knowledge (i.e., channel features) and response-based knowledge (i.e., logits) at different stages, respectively; and CRD encourages the student model to conduct self-reflective learning after each stage by a self-distillation of the response-based knowledge.

With the increase of the number of courses, it is difficult for learners to find the courses they want quickly and accurately; that is, they encounter the problems of information overload and cognitive maze. Therefore, how to recommend personalized courses for learners according to their preferences has become one of the important problems that need to be solved urgently to improve the service quality of courses in online learning platforms. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of course recommendation, it is necessary to build an accurate and complete learner model. In order to improve the application effect of recommendation, this paper focuses on the recommendation method of emotional factors to improve the recommendation efficiency of learning resources. The traditional recommendation model is a method based on the user's purchase behavior and historical information. However, in the emotional factors, the effect of traditional recommendation is limited. This paper proposes a recommendation method based on emotional factors, which may consider the emotional and psychological factors of scholars according to the learning content of learners. The experimental results show that the learner model incorporating learners' affection can reflect learners' preferences more accurately, and the use of deep neural factorization machine for curriculum recommendation can effectively improve the accuracy of curriculum recommendation.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,1058-9244,1875-919X,,,,,,,"Changsha Normal Univ, Changsha 410100, Hunan, Peoples R ChinaHunan Prov Res Inst Educ, Changsha 410105, Hunan, Peoples R China",Changsha Normal UnivHunan Prov Res Inst Educ,,,2022-05-27,WOS:000796665400004,

In a previous work, we proposed a procedure for deriving a learner model for automatic skill assessment from a task-specific competence rubric, thus simpli-fying the implementation of automated assessment tools. The previous approach, however, suffered two main limitations: (i) the ordering between competencies defined by the assessment rubric was only indirectly modelled; (ii) supplementary skills, not under assessment but necessary for accomplishing the task, were not included in the model. In this work, we address issue (i) by introducing dummy observed nodes, strictly enforcing the skills ordering without changing the network's structure. In contrast, for point (ii), we design a network with two layers of gates, one performing disjunctive operations by noisy-OR gates and the other conjunctive operations through logical ANDs. Such changes improve the model outcomes' coherence and the modelling tool's flexibility without compromising the model's compact parametrisation, interpretability and simple experts' elicitation. We used this approach to develop a learner model for Computational Thinking (CT) skills assessment.

Adaptive web-based educational systems aim to cater individual learners by customizing courses to suit their needs. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of incorporating learning styles and cognitive traits in web-based educational systems. Adaptivity aspects based on cognitive traits and learning styles enrich each other, enabling systems to provide learners with courses which fit their needs more accurately. Furthermore, consideration of learning styles and cognitive traits can contribute to more accurate student modelling. In this paper, the relationship between learning styles, in particular the Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM), and working memory capacity. a cognitive trait, is investigated. For adaptive educational systems that consider either only learning styles or only cognitive traits, the additional information can be used to provide more holistic adaptivity. For systems that already incorporate both learning styles and cognitive traits, the relationship can be used to improve the detection process of both by including the additional information of learning style into the detection process of cognitive traits and vice versa.

One of the possible uses of games in education is as game-based assessments (GBA), using game tasks to generate evidence about skills and content knowledge that can be valuable. There are different approaches in the literature to implement the assessment machinery of these GBA, all of them having strengths and drawbacks. In this article, we propose using multivariate Elo-based learner modeling, as we believe it has a strong potential in the context of GBA for three aims: first, to simultaneously measure students competence across several knowledge components in a game; second, to predict task performance; and finally, to estimate task difficulty within the game. To do so, we present our GBA Shadowspect, which is focused on solving geometry puzzles, and we depict our implementation using data collected from several high schools across the USA. We obtain high-performing results (AUC of 0.87) and demonstrate that the model enables analysis of how each student's competency evolves after each puzzle attempt. Moreover, the model provides accurate estimations of each task's difficulty, enabling iterative improvement of the game design.

The abundance of available content has produced at least two problems: how to help students find the most appropriate resources and how to engage them in using and benefiting from these resources. Personalized and social learning have been suggested as potential ways to address these problems. Our work attempts to integrate these directions of research by combining the ideas of adaptive navigation support and open student modeling with the ideas of social comparison and social visualization. We call our approach Open Social Student Modeling (OSSM).Objective/Research Questions: First, we review a sequence of our earlier projects focused on Open Social Student Modeling for one kind of learning content and formulate several key design principles that contribute to the success of OSSM. Second, we present our exploration of OSSM in a more challenging context of modeling student progress for two kinds of learning content in parallel. We aim to answer the following research questions: How do we design OSSM interfaces to support many kinds of learning content in parallel? Will current identified design principles (key features) confirm the power of the learning community through OSSM with multiple learning-resource collections? Will the OSSM visualization provide successful personalized guidance within a richer collection of educational resources?Research Design: We designed four classroom studies to assess the value of different options for OSSM visualization of one and multiple kinds of learning content in the context of programming-language learning. We examined the comparative success of different design options to distill successful design patterns and other important lessons for the future developers of OSSM for personalized and social e-learning.Findings/Results: The results confirmed the motivational impact of personalized social guidance provided by the OSSM system in the target context. The interface encouraged students to explore more topics and motivated them to work ahead of the course schedule. Both strong and weak students worked with the appropriate levels of questions for their readiness, which yielded consistent performance across different levels of complex problems. Additionally, providing more realistic content collection on the navigation-supported OSSM visualizations resulted in uniform performance for the group.Conclusions/Recommendation: A sequence of studies of several OSSM interfaces confirmed that a combination of adaptive navigational support, open student modeling, and social visualization in the form of the OSSM interface can reinforce the navigational and motivational values of these approaches. In several contexts, the OSSM interface demonstrated its ability to offer effective guidance in helping students to locate the most relevant content at the right time while increasing student motivation to work with diverse learning content.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,11,,,0161-4681,1467-9620,,,,,,,"Arizona State Univ, Comp Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USAUniv Pittsburgh, Informat Sci & Intelligent Syst, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000412871200008,

Personal traits comprise part of the components in a learner model and can be identified either explicitly or implicitly in an adaptive learning environment. In such an environment, the e-learning system should adapt to a learner's needs. However, even though academic research on adaptive learning environments has increased, the field lacks a comprehensive literature analysis of learners' personal traits in these environments. This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify the most commonly used personal traits in modelling the learner and the existing techniques suitable for identifying personal traits in an adaptive learning environment. A total of 140 articles spanning the years 2010-2017 are initially reviewed, from which 78 are selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria relevant to this study. This study provides an overview of learners' personal traits and the techniques used to identify them to provide a basis for improving adaptive learning environments. The findings indicate that most of the previous works used a learning style from the cognition learning domain category to model individual personal traits, while the computer based detection technique was commonly applied to identify a learner's personal traits in adaptive learning environments. This study reveals the common learner characteristics used to develop learner models and the techniques for implementing such models.

Despite an accurate predictive performance of such models, it is challenging to interpret their behaviors and obtain an intuitive insight into latent student learning status. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new learner modeling framework named the EAKT, which embeds a structured cognitive model into a transformer. In this way, the EAKT not only can achieve an excellent prediction result of learning outcome but also can depict students' knowledge state on a multi-dimensional knowledge component(KC) level. By performing the fine-grained analysis of the student learning process, the proposed framework provides better explanatory learner models for designing and implementing intelligent tutoring systems. The proposed EAKT is verified by experiments. The performance experiments show that the EAKT can better predict the future performance of student learning(more than 2.6% higher than the baseline method on two of three real-world datasets). The interpretability experiments demonstrate that the student knowledge state obtained by EAKT is closer to ground truth than other models, which means EAKT can more accurately trace changes in the students' knowledge state.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,"Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R ChinaBeihang Univ, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",,,,2022-11-04,WOS:000870820900097,36266397

INSPIRE, throughout its interaction with the learner, dynamically generates learner-tailored lessons that gradually lead to the accomplishment of learner's learning goals. It supports several levels of adaptation: from full system-control to full learner-control, and offers learners the option to decide on the level of adaptation of the system by intervening in different stages of the lesson generation process and formulating the lesson contents and presentation. Both the adaptive and adaptable behavior of INSPIRE are guided by the learner model which provides information about the learner, such as knowledge level on the domain concepts and learning style.

The current study involved a content analysis of recent studies on adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) which addressed learning styles. After an extensive search on electronic databases, seventy studies were selected and exposed to a document analysis. Study features were classified under several themes such as the research purposes, methodology, features of adaptive interventions and student modeling, and findings. The analysis revealed that the majority of studies proposed a framework or model for adaptivity whereas few studies addressed the effectiveness of learning style-based AEH. Scales were used for learning style identification more than automatic student modeling. One third of the studies provided a framework without empirical evaluation with students. Findings on concrete learning outcomes were not strong enough: however, several studies revealed that suggested models influenced student satisfaction and success.

But a majority of the e-learning systems merely focuses on instruction delivery with little focus on learning activities and thus creating opportunities to develop e-learning more interactive and engaging by adding adaptive features. However, it is also a challenging task to develop and implement an adaptive e-learning model for an ODL environment. There are various issues like non-availability of the specialized contents, the learning sequence story board and the preferences of learners under the available infrastructure. This paper proposes a model of adaptive c-learning for an ODL environment. The proposed model has three important components: content model, learner model and adaptive model The content model defines and stores the organization of chapters and topics in a logical sequence. The learner model stores information about survey and quizzes data and keep the track of the learning performance. The survey is designed to investigate the personal profiles and the preference of students about their favorite content types. The adaptive model manages content presentation and its navigation derived by the learning algorithm. The learning algorithm takes information from the learner model, analyzes it and adjusts the display of the contents by retrieving it from the content model. The implementation was conducted on two courses of computer science and in each course the experimental and control groups were formed to investigate the change in their learning level. The results show that the proposed adaptive e-learning model has improved the knowledge level of the students. The percentage of highest grade holders has increased and the failure rate has dropped in both courses. The feedback of the students enrolled in adaptive e-learning course is also conducted.

With this approach both student modeling and adaptation are based on coarse-grained knowledge units that we called topics. Our motivation for the topic-based personalization was to enhance AES transparency for both teachers and students by utilizing typical topic-based course structures as the foundation for designing all aspects of an AES from the domain model to the end-user interface. We illustrate the details of the topic-based personalization technology, with the help of the Web-based educational service QuizGuide-the first system to implement it. QuizGuide applies the topic-based personalization to guide students to the right learning material in the context of an undergraduate C programming course. While having a number of architectural and practical advantages, the suggested coarse-grained personalization approach deviates from the common practices toward knowledge modeling in AES. Therefore, we believe that several aspects of QuizGuide required a detailed evaluation-from modeling accuracy to the effectiveness of adaptation. The paper discusses how this new student modeling approach can be evaluated, and presents our attempts to evaluate it from multiple different prospects.

However, most existing KT methods focus on a single aspect of knowledge or learner, not paying careful attention to the coupling influence of knowledge and learner characteristics. To fill this gap, in this paper, we explore a new paradigm for the KT task by exploiting the coupling influence of knowledge and learner. A novel model called Dual-Centric Knowledge Tracing (DCKT) is proposed to model knowledge states through two joint tasks of knowledge modeling and learner modeling. In particular, we first generate concept embeddings in abundant knowledge structure information via a pretext task (knowledge-centric): unsupervised graph representation learning. Then, we deeply measure learners' prior knowledge the knowledge-enhanced representations and three predefined educational priors for discriminative feature enhancement. Furthermore, we design a forgetting-fusion transformer (learner-centric) to simulate the declining trend of learners' knowledge proficiency over time, representing the common forgetting phenomenon. Extensive experiments were conducted on four public datasets, and the results demonstrate that DCKT could achieve better knowledge tracing results over all datasets via a dual-centric modeling process. Additionally, DCKT can learn meaningful question embeddings automatically without manual annotations.

However, the student modeling methods embedded within intelligent tutoring systems remain focused on assessing basic skill learning rather than robust learning. Recent work has proposed models, developed using educational data mining, that infer whether students are acquiring learning that transfers to related skills, and prepares the student for future learning (PFL). In this earlier work, evidence was presented that these models achieve superior prediction of robust learning to what can be achieved by traditional methods for student modeling. However, using these models to drive intervention by educational software depends on evidence that these models remain effective within new populations. To this end, we analyze the degree to which these detectors remain accurate for an entirely new population of high school students. We find limited evidence of degradation for transfer.

While PBL has many strengths, effective PBL tutoring is time-intensive and requires the tutor to provide a high degree of personal attention to the students, which is difficult in the current academic environment of increasing demands on faculty time. This paper describes the student modeling approach used in the COMET intelligent tutoring system for collaborative medical PBL. To generate appropriate tutorial actions, COMET uses a model of each student's clinical reasoning for the problem domain. In addition, since problem solving in group PBL is a collaborative process, COMET uses a group model that enables it to do things like focus the group discussion, promote collaboration, and suggest peer helpers. Bayesian networks are used to model individual student knowledge and activity, as well as that of the group. The validity of the modeling approach has been tested with student models in the areas of head injury, stroke, and heart attack. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows that the models are highly accurate in predicting individual student actions. Comparison with human tutors shows that the focus of group activity determined by the model agrees with that suggested by the majority of the human tutors with a high degree of statistical agreement (McNemar test, p = 0.774, Kappa = 0.823).",,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,3,0,29,,,0924-1868,1573-1391,,,,,,,"Thammasat Univ, Sch Dent, Clin Skill Dev Unit, Pathum Thani 12121, ThailandAsian Inst Technol, Comp Sci & Informat Management Program, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand",,,,2006-09-01,WOS:000240914200003,

Therefore, mobile devices can be adopted to fill the gap between Web-based learning and ubiquitous mobile learning. This study first creates a website, providing functions enabling learning to take place anytime and anywhere with any available learning device, for ubiquitous learning according to various properties of mobile devices. Nowadays, learners' behaviors on a website can be recorded as learning portfolios and analyzed for behavioral diagnosis or instructional planning. A student model is then built according to the analytical results of learning portfolios and a concept map of the learning domain. Based on the student model and learners' available learning devices, three modules are developed to build a ubiquitous learning environment to enhance learning performance via learning status awareness, schedule reminders and mentor recommendation. Finally, an experiment is conducted with 54 college students after implementation of the ubiquitous learning website.

This paper reviews the relevant studies in EDM including datasets and techniques used in those studies and identifies the most effective techniques. The most prevalent applications include predicting student performance, detecting undesirable student behaviors, grouping students and student modeling. These applications aim to help decision makers in the educational institutions to understand student situations, improve students' performance, identify learning priorities for different groups of students and develop learning process. The prediction accuracy is selected as the evaluation criteria for the effectiveness of educational data mining techniques. The results show that Bayesian Network and Random Forest are the most effective techniques for predicting student performance, Social Network Analysis is the best technique for detecting undesirable student behaviors, Clustering and Social Network Analysis are the most effective techniques for grouping students and student modeling, respectively.

MG is a digital learning activity that supports pupils in achieving multiplication competence and provides teacher a dashboard to assess and watch own pupils' performance. The game enriched with gamification elements to engage and motivate participants. Three versions of the game were used by pupils: without any Open Learner Modeling (OLM) support (i.e. without providing access to own progress data), with OLM support and with Open Social Learner Modeling (OSLM) support, to investigate the difference in motivation among these characteristics. After using the MG for a 2-month period, pupils answered a questionnaire anonymously to express their opinion about MG mechanics, MG aesthetics and intrinsic motivation MG can offer. Furthermore, the corresponding teachers were interviewed to provide insights on their attitude towards MG and its functionalities. A statistically significant difference in Intrinsic Motivation (IM) between the three different MG versions was found and a statistically significant difference in MG Aesthetics and Mechanics between the different grades of primary school. Additionally, Intrinsic Motivation was positively correlated with gamification motivators and MG Aesthetics.

Educational technologies (e.g., learning analytics, student modelling, and intelligent tutoring systems) bring great potential to online education. Many online courses, particularly in self-paced online learning (SPOL), face some inherent barriers such as learning awareness and academic intervention. These barriers can affect the academic performance of online learners. Recently, learning analytics has been shown to have great potential in removing these barriers. However, it is challenging to achieve the full potential of learning analytics with the traditional online course learning design model. Thus, focusing on SPOL, this study proposes that learning analytics should be included in the course learning design loop to ensure data collection and pedagogical connection. We propose a novel learning design-analytics model in which course learning design and learning analytics can support each other to increase learning success. Based on the proposed model, a set of online course design strategies are recommended for online educators who wish to use learning analytics to mitigate the learning barriers in SPOL. These strategies and technologies are inspired by Jim Greer's work on student modelling. By following these recommended design strategies, a computer science course is used as an example to show our initial practices of including learning analytics in the course learning design loop.

Data were transcribed, verbatim, and manually coded and analysed by the researcher using the applied research methodology of framework analysis, enabling the investigation of the a priori theme 'practice placement model', and recommendations were made for improvement.Results: Two radiotherapy placement models are confirmed, i.e. the single student model, and the paired student model, and advantages and disadvantages are identified for each. Study findings suggest that neither radiotherapy model is superior to the other in terms of placement education and experience. Previous and current experience of either model appears to bias students and practice educators towards that model, despite recognition of its disadvantages.Conclusion: The experiences of students and practice educators using the radiotherapy models are consistent with the experiences of other AHPs and nursing using similar practice placement models. It is recommended that all students should have access to peer-assisted learning on placement to improve critical thinking skills, to enable time for reflection, and to consolidate learning.

A model of this system is presented. It describes integration of the learner and teacher and determines a teaching-learning process in its two forms. The realization is possible only in learning environment. The main characteristic of the learning environment is that it provides resources to the teaching-learning process.

However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge; in addition to being a poor model of human acquisition of prior knowledge, manual knowledge-encoding is both time-consuming and error-prone. Previous research has shown that one of the key factors that differentiates experts and novices is their different representations of knowledge. Experts view the world in terms of deep functional features, while novices view it in terms of shallow perceptual features. Moreover, since the performance of learning algorithms is sensitive to representation, the deep features are also important in achieving effective machine learning. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm that acquires representation knowledge in the form of deep features, and demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain of algebra as well as synthetic domains. We integrate this algorithm into a machine-learning agent, SimStudent, which learns procedural knowledge by observing a tutor solve sample problems, and by getting feedback while actively solving problems on its own. We show that learning deep features reduces the requirements for knowledge engineering. Moreover, we propose an approach that automatically discovers student models using the extended SimStudent. By fitting the discovered model to real student learning curve data, we show that it is a better student model than human-generated models, and demonstrate how the discovered model may be used to improve a tutoring system's instructional strategy.

First, adding Open Learner Models (OLM) to learning environments encourages self-regulation by providing clear feedback on which skills students need to prioritize. Second, gamifying these environments holds the potential to maximize student motivation. Nevertheless, empirical evidence on whether gamification improves learning self-regulation in OLM-based applications is lacking to our best knowledge. Therefore, we conducted a one-factor (gamification: yes or no) experimental study (n = 39) to test if gamification improves the self-regulation and performance of learners who used an OLM-based Intelligent Tutoring System to complete multiple-choice questions. Surprisingly, we found no significant differences in self-regulation and performance when comparing the gamified and non-gamified groups. Considering prior research did not investigate gamification in similar settings, the fact that gamification's effect varies depending on the context and learning outcome likely explains our findings. Thus, practitioners must be cautious in using gamification amid the lack of empirical evidence on its effectiveness in a given context/learning outcome.

However, constructing tutoring systems that are pedagogically effective has been widely recognized as a challenging problem (Murray 2003; Murray, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10, 98-129, 1999).

To support these investigations, we present the Apprentice Learner Architecture, which posits the types of knowledge, performance, and learning components needed for apprentice learning. We use this architecture to create two models: the Decision Tree model, which non-incrementally learns skills, and the Trestle model, which instead learns incrementally. Both models draw on the same small set of prior knowledge (six operators and three types of relational knowledge) to support expert model authoring. Despite their limited prior knowledge, we demonstrate their use for efficiently authoring a novel experimental design tutor and show that they are capable of learning an expert model for seven additional tutoring systems that teach a wide range of knowledge types (associations, categories, and skills) across multiple domains (language, math, engineering, and science). This work shows that apprentice learner models are efficient for authoring tutors that would be difficult to build with existing non-programmer authoring approaches (e.g., experimental design or stoichiometry tutors). Further, we show that these models can be applied to author tutors across eight tutor domains even though they only have a small, fixed set of prior knowledge.

In two classroom experiments with a total of 302 7th- and 8th-grade students, we investigated the effect of (a) an OLM that supports students' self-assessment of their equation-solving skills and (b) shared control over problem selection, on students' equation-solving abilities, enjoyment of learning with the tutor, self-assessment accuracy, and problem selection decisions. In the first, smaller experiment, the hypothesized main effect of the OLM on students' learning outcomes was confirmed; we found no main effect of shared control of problem selection, nor an interaction. In the second, larger experiment, the hypothesized main effects were not confirmed, but we found an interaction such that the students who had access to the OLM learned significantly better equation-solving skills than their counterparts when shared control over problem selection was offered in the system. Thus, the two experiments support the notion that an OLM can enhance students' domain-level learning outcomes through scaffolding of SRL processes, and are among the first in-vivo classroom experiments to do so. They suggest that an OLM is especially effective if it is designed to support multiple SRL processes.",,,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,1,0,45,,,0924-1868,1573-1391,,,,,,,"Univ Pittsburgh, Learning Res & Dev Ctr, 3939 OHara St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USACarnegie Mellon Univ, Human Comp Interact Inst, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000395032400003,

While many pre-college students use system modeling tools, there is limited evidence of student reasoning about causal relationships that interact in diverging and converging chains, and how these affect system behavior. A chemistry unit on gas phenomena was implemented in two successive years with 73 high school students. Although the phenomena could be explained with simple linear causal reasoning, many student models included surprising and problematic causal chains and non-linear patterns. Commonly, discussion about student models in classrooms and interviews focuses on individual causal relationships. However, in our experience, this can fail to bring to the surface conceptual issues that result from the combination of two or more relationships. Using interview data from 19 students, we looked for instances where students explained their conceptions and we identified questioning strategies that elicited these explanations. Questions that appeared most productive asked about distal relationships between nonadjacent variables in model substructures of three to four variables. In response to these questions, eight students expressed their thinking about relationship combinations, including unexpected reasoning that had not emerged during classroom instruction. Using exemplars from three interviews, we argue that students engage in complex causal reasoning that may be implicit and unexpected, and that if this is not recognized, it cannot be responded to during instruction. We suggest that using model substructures as a mutual visual referent along with a simple questioning strategy shows promise for helping students make their causal reasoning explicit.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1571-0068,1573-1774,,,,,,,"Concord Consortium, 25 Love Lane, Concord, MA 01742 USAMichigan State Univ, CREATE STEM Inst, 620 Farm Lane,Suite 115, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA",Concord Consortium,,,2022-09-17,WOS:000852937600001,

Presently, e-learning Recommender Systems rely on deep learning methods to recommend appropriate e-learning materials to the students based on their learner profiles. Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) can be leveraged to enrich the recommender system. Users posted reviews and rating data are vital in accurately directing the student to the appropriate e-learning resources based on posted comments by comparable learners. Innovative has been made in this work to propose a new e-learning recommendation system based on individualization and FSA. A new framework is proposed based on collaborative filtering models (CFMs) integrating with fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) for hybrid recommendation (CFISAR) for effective recommendations. CFMs attempt to capture the learner's latent factors based on their selections of interest to build the learner profile. FSA models are introduced to deliver e-content with the highest ranked ratings related to the learner's area and interests based on the extracted learner model. Moreover, a new approach is proposed to update the system continuously and not keep it bound to certain items by adding new books, where the initial rating of these new books is predicted based on FSA models. CFISAR is explored utilizing six CFMs to generate the prediction matrix and derive the learner model, resulting in a low MSE of 0.699 for Asymmetric SVD. The system used multiplication word embeddings for stronger corpus representation that were trained on a dataset generated for an educational context, and leveraging the goodness of deep learning, which predicted an accuracy of 0.9264% for the Peephole algorithm, that performed better than other models.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0920-8542,1573-0484,,,,,,,"CV Raman Global Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Bhubaneswar 752054, Orissa, India",CV Raman Global Univ,,,2023-10-13,WOS:001069527200002,

We explored these questions in Decimal Point, a digital learning game that teaches decimal numbers and operations to 5th and 6th graders, through a classroom study with 159 students and two versions of the game. One version encouraged playing and learning through an open learner model (OLM, N = 55), while one encouraged playing for enjoyment through an analogous open enjoyment model (OEM, N = 54). We compared these versions to a control version that is neutral with respect to learning and enjoyment (N = 50). While students learned in all three conditions, our results indicated no significant condition differences in learning outcomes, enjoyment, or engagement. However, the learning-oriented group engaged more in re-practicing, while the enjoyment-oriented group demonstrated more exploration of different mini-games. Further analyses of students' interactions with the open learner and enjoyment models revealed that students who followed the learner model demonstrated better in-game learning and test performance, while following the enjoyment model did not impact learning outcomes. These findings indicate that emphasizing learning or enjoyment can lead to distinctive game play behaviors, and that open learner models can be helpful in a learning game context. In turn, our analyses have led to preliminary ideas about how to use AI to provide recommendations that are more aligned with students' dynamic learning and enjoyment states and preferences.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,1560-4292,1560-4306,,,,,,,"Carnegie Mellon Univ, Human Comp Interact Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",,,,2021-05-04,WOS:000639750900001,

This competitive initiative sponsored four teams that separately developed systems that covered topics in mathematics, electronics, and dynamical systems. After the teams shared their progress at the conclusion of an 18-month period, the ONR decided to fund a joint applied project in the Navy that integrated those systems on the subject matter of electronic circuits. The University of Memphis took the lead in integrating these systems in an intelligent tutoring system called ElectronixTutor. This article describes the architecture of ElectronixTutor, the learning resources that feed into it, and the empirical findings that support the effectiveness of its constituent ITS learning resources.Results: A fully integrated ElectronixTutor was developed that included several intelligent learning resources (AutoTutor, Dragoon, LearnForm, ASSISTments, BEETLE-II) as well as texts and videos. The architecture includes a student model that has (a) a common set of knowledge components on electronic circuits to which individual learning resources contribute and (b) a record of student performance on the knowledge components as well as a set of cognitive and non-cognitive attributes. There is a recommender system that uses the student model to guide the student on a small set of sensible next steps in their training. The individual components of ElectronixTutor have shown learning gains in previous decades of research.Conclusions: The ElectronixTutor system successfully combines multiple empirically based components into one system to teach a STEM topic (electronics) to students. A prototype of this intelligent tutoring system has been developed and is currently being tested.

This paper proposes a novel approach to maintain the benefits of the semantic web-based approach in representing pedagogical rules for an ITS, while overcoming its main drawback by employing a data mining technique to automatically extract rules from real-world tutoring sessions and represent them by means of Web Ontology Language (OWL).",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,1,21,,,2169-3536,,,,,,,,"Athabasca Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Syst, Edmonton, AB T5J 3S8, CanadaAsia Univ, Dept M Commerce & Multimedia Applicat, Taichung 41354, TaiwanUniv Salerno, Dept Informat & Elect Engn & Appl Math, I-84084 Fisciano, ItalyUniv Salerno, Dept Management & Innovat Syst, I-84084 Fisciano, ItalyUniv Piraeus, Dept Digital Syst, Piraeus 18534, GreeceCurtin Univ, Sch Educ, Perth, WA 6102, AustraliaNTT DATA Italia Spa, I-80143 Naples, Italy",NTT DATA Italia Spa,,,2020-04-23,WOS:000524689500012,

CMKT considers the concept map as a new information source and explicitly exploits its inherent information to help the estimation of the learner's knowledge state. Specifically, the pairwise educational relations in the concept map are formulated as the ordering pairs and are used as mathematical constraints for model construction. The topology information in the concept map is extracted and used as the model input by employing the network embedding techniques. Integrating both educational relation information and topology information in the concept map, CMKT adopts the recurrent neural network to perform knowledge tracing tasks. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on five public educational datasets of four different subjects (more than 8000 learners and their 300 000 records) demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of CMKT: The average area under ROC curve (AUC) and overall prediction accuracy (ACC) achieve 0.82 and 0.75, respectively, and CMKT outperforms all the baselines by at least 12.2% and 9.2% in terms of AUC and ACC.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,1939-1382,,,,,,,,"Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Educ, Adv Innovat Ctr Future Educ, Sch Educ Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Normal Univ, Fac Educ, Sch Educ Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R ChinaAdv Digital Sci Ctr, Singapore 138602, Singapore",Adv Digital Sci Ctr,,,2022-09-21,WOS:000853835200006,

The teaching strategy inference engine cuts the domain knowledge tree, selects the knowledge points suitable for the student, and sorts the selected knowledge points reasonably to generate an optimal teaching sequence. According to the students' learning situation, combined with the teaching rules in the teaching rule library, the students' grades are dynamically adjusted, so as to select new learning content for students and provide teaching suggestions in time.

ITS focuses on a newer and more comprehensive distance learning (DL) process as compared to the established traditional DL programs practiced today. The DL model presented in this paper (CHARLIE) is a high level software based tutorial that has the ability to encompass a wide variety of current DL technologies in a single DL session. CHARLIE's architecture has four components: Control Component (responsible for the interaction between software agents and the operating system); Instructional Component (concerned with the instructional aspects of an ITS session); Text Analysis Component (analyzes the partial syntax and partial semantics of the text in the session); Student Modeling Component (analyzes a student's progress and determines the best model for learning during a session). Each component is serviced by a set of software agents to accomplish its mission. Three additional entities in CHARLIE are two separate databases and an explanation facility. Six agents have been implemented in CHARLIE to create a DL course in C++ programming. Much of CHARLIE remains to be completed which opens many areas for research.,,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,1335-9150,,,,,,,,"St Peters Coll, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Jersey City, NJ 07306 USA",St Peters Coll,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000253381500001,

The aim is to enhance the learning of students by the self-adaptation of a Web-based educational system (WBES). The adaptive system's behavior is achieved as a result of the decisions made by a student model (SM). The decision reveals the lecture option most suitable to teach a concept according to the student's profile. Thus, the lecture content is authored from different view points (e.g. learning theory, type of media, complexity level, and user-system interaction degree). The purpose is to tailor several educational options to teach a given concept. Thereby, the SM elicits psychological attributes of the student to describe subjective traits, such as: cognitive, personality, and learning preferences. It also depicts pedagogical properties of the available lecture's options. Moreover, the SM dynamically builds a cognitive map (CM) to set fuzzy-causal relationships among the lecture's option properties and the student's attributes. Based on a fuzzy-causal engine, the SM predicts the bias that a lecture's option exerts on the student's apprenticeship. The conceptual, theoretical, and formal grounds of the approach were tested by a computer implementation of the SM and an experiment. As a result of a field trial, we found that: the average learning acquired by an experimental group of volunteers that used this approach was 17% higher than the average apprenticeship of another equivalent control group, whose lectures were randomly chosen. Thus we conclude that: learning is better stimulated when the delivered lectures account a student's profile than when they ignore it.

However, effective learning-in-action also depends on the extent to which students are active-in-thinking, making meaning of their learning experience. A critical component of any technology to support active thinking is the ability to ascertain whether (or to what extent) students have succeeded in internalizing the disciplinary strategies, norms of thinking, discourse practices and habits of mind that characterize deep understanding in a domain. This presents what we call a dilemma of modeling-in-context: teachers routinely analyze this kind of thinking for small numbers of students in activities they create or customize for the needs of their students; however, doing so at scale and in real-time requires some automated processes for modeling student work. Current techniques for developing models that reflect specific pedagogical activities and learning objectives that a teacher might create require either more expertise or more time than teachers have. In this paper, we examine a theoretical approach to addressing the problem of modeling active thinking in its pedagogical context that uses teacher-created rubrics to generate models of student work. The results of this examination show how appropriately constructed learning technologies can enable teachers to develop custom automated rubrics for modeling active thinking and meaning-making from the records of students' dialogic work. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Many immersive educational technologies, such as digital games and simulations, enable students to take consequential action in a realistic context and to interact with peers, mentors and pedagogical agents. Such technologies help students to be active-in-thinking: engaging deeply with, reflecting on and otherwise making meaning of their learning experience. There are now many immersive educational technologies with integrated authoring tools that enable teachers to customize the learning experience with relative ease, reducing barriers to adoption and improving student learning. Educational technologies that support learning-in-action typically contain student models that operate in real-time to control the behavior of pedagogical agents, deliver just-in-time interventions, select an appropriate content or otherwise measure and promote active thinking, but these student models may not work appropriately if teachers customize the learning experience. Much as there are authoring tools that allow teachers to customize the curriculum of a given learning technology, there is a need for authoring tools that allow teachers to customize the associated student models as well. What this paper adds This paper presents a novel, rubric-based approach to develop automated student models for new activities that teachers develop in digital learning environments that promote active thinking. Our approach combines machine learning techniques with teacher expertise, allowing teachers to participate in the design of automated student models of active thinking that with further development could be scaled by leveraging their skills in rubric development. Our results show that a rubric-based approach can outperform a machine learning approach in this context. More importantly, in some cases, the rubric-based approach can produce reliable automated models based on the information that a teacher can easily provide.Implications for practice and/or policy If integrated into authoring tools, the rubric-based approach could allow teachers to participate in the design of automated models for educational technologies customized to their instructional needs. Through this design process, teachers could develop a better understanding of how the automated modeling system works, which in turn could increase the adoption of educational technologies that promote active thinking. Because the rubric-based approach enables teachers to identify key connections among concepts relevant to the pedagogical context, rather than general concepts or linguistic features, it is more likely to facilitate targeted feedback to help promote the development of active thinking.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,0007-1013,1467-8535,,,,,,,"Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Educ Psychol, Learning Sci Program, Madison, WI USAUniv Wisconsin Madison, Wisconsin Ctr Educ Res, Madison, WI USAUniv Memphis, Dept Comp Sci, Memphis, TN 38152 USAUniv Memphis, Comp Sci, Memphis, TN 38152 USAUniv Wisconsin Madison, Dept Educ Psychol, Learning Sci, Madison, WI USAAalborg Univ, Learning Analyt, Copenhagen, DenmarkWisconsin Ctr Educ Res, Madison, WI USA",Wisconsin Ctr Educ Res,,,2019-08-04,WOS:000479641100001,

The investigated functions, inspired by manifold-to-manifold distance measures, are designed to compare the neighboring information inside the feature space of the involved activations without any restrictions in the features' dimensionality, thus enabling knowledge transfer between different architectures. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the proposed technique is effective in different settings, including knowledge-transfer to smaller models, transfer between different deep architectures and harnessing knowledge from external data, producing models with increased accuracy compared to a typical training. Furthermore, results indicate that the presented method can work synergistically with methods such as knowledge distillation, further increasing the accuracy of the trained models.

Investment in this technology will be needed to succeed in developing ITSs for team training. The purpose of this chapter is to propose an instructional framework for guiding team ITS researchers in their development of these models for reuse. We establish a foundation for the framework with three propositions. First, we propose that understanding how teams develop is needed to establish a science-based foundation for modeling. Toward this end, we conduct a detailed exploration of the Kozlowski, Watola, Jensen, Kim, and Botero (2009) theory of team development and leadership, and describe a use case example to demonstrate how team training was developed for a specific stage in their model. Next, we propose that understanding measures of learning and performance will inform learner modeling requirements for each stage of team development. We describe measures developed for the use case and how they were used to understand teamwork skill development. We then discuss effective team training strategies and explain how they were implemented in the use case to understand their implications for pedagogical modeling. From this exploration, we describe a generic instructional framework recommending effective training strategies for each stage of team development. To inform the development of reusable models, we recommend selecting different team task domains and varying team size to begin researching commonalities and differences in the instructional framework.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,1534-0856,,978-1-78754-473-4; 978-1-78754-474-1,,,,,,"US Army Res Lab, Human Res & Engn Directorate, Adelphi, MD 20783 USAUniv Cent Florida, Inst Simulat & Training, Orlando, FL 32816 USANaval Air Warfare Ctr, Training Syst Div, Ridgecrest, CA USACognit Performance Grp Inc, Independence, OH USARice Univ, Dept Psychol, Houston, TX 77251 USA",Cognit Performance Grp Inc,,,2019-12-16,WOS:000488080100005,

To identify the students at risk in different courses, we applied classification algorithms on context-bound cognitive skill scores of a student to estimate the chances of success or failure, especially failure. The context-bound cognitive skill scores were aggregated based on the learning objective of a course to generate meaningful visual feedback to teachers and students so that they can understand why some students are predicted to be at risk. Evaluation of the generated model shows that this feature is applicable in a range of courses, and it mitigates the effort in engineering features/models for each domain.

Technically, imbalanced data resource can cause more difficulties or limitations for learning algorithms to distinguish different classes, while data with labeling errors can lead to an unreasonable problem formulation due to incorrect hypotheses. Indeed, noise and class imbalance are pervasive problems in the domain of educational data analytics. This study aims at developing improved randomized learning algorithms by investigating a novel type of cost function that focuses on the combined effects of class imbalance and class noise.

Our experimental study on several educational data classification tasks have verified the advantages of our proposed algorithms, in comparison with some existing methods that either takes no account of class imbalance and labeling errors, or merely consider one specific aspect in problem-solving.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0010-485X,1436-5057,,,,,,,"South China Normal Univ, Sch Informat Technol Educ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSouth China Normal Univ, Guangdong Engn Res Ctr Smart Learning, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaLa Trobe Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic, AustraliaNortheastern Univ, State Key Lab Synthet Automat Proc Ind, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China",,,,2019-05-27,WOS:000467041900005,

In this article, we propose an alternative, a generic and comprehensive peer assessment platform, called LearnEval, which is very flexible and able to accommodate a variety of pedagogical scenarios. Distinctive functionalities include: highly configurable peer assessment workflow, several automatic and manual review allocation mechanisms, initial calibration/training options for the students, complex dashboard with statistics, scores and graphical visualizations, as well as an extensive open learner model. The platform was developed in an iterative manner, with several extensions and improvements informed by the findings of the initial pilot studies. The article also reports on a practical application of LearnEval in a project-based learning scenario, with very promising results; multiple perspectives of the peer assessment process are analyzed: student behavior, peer grades validity, and perceived learning experience.

This study deals with the content analysis of the recent studies on Adaptive Educational Hypermedia (AEH) based on learning styles. 69 articles published from 2005 to 2014 were obtained through a comprehensive and detailed review. Afterwards, these studies were subjected to document analysis. The studies were categorized under the titles of purpose, nature, method, characteristics of examinees, level, data collection tool, learner modelling, learning styles, subject, and findings. Some of the studies offered a framework or proposed a model for AEH while others focused on the influence of AEH on academic achievement and learning outputs as well as learning satisfaction.

Student models include a range of information about the learners such as their domain competence, learning style or cognitive traits. To be able to adapt to the learners' needs in an appropriate way, a reliable student model is necessary, but getting enough information about a learner is quite challenging. Therefore, mechanisms are needed to support the detection process of the required information. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between learning styles, in particular, those pertaining to the Felder-Silverman learning style model and working memory capacity, one of the cognitive traits included in the cognitive trait model. The identified relationship is derived from links between learning styles, cognitive styles, and working memory capacity which are based on studies from the literature. As a result, we demonstrate that learners with high working memory capacity tend to prefer a reflective, intuitive, and sequential learning style whereas learners with low working memory capacity tend to prefer an active, sensing, visual, and global learning style. This interaction can be used to improve the student model. Systems which are able to detect either only cognitive traits or only learning styles retrieve additional information through the identified relationship. Otherwise, for systems that already incorporate learning styles and cognitive traits, the interaction can be used to improve the detection process of both by including the additional information of a learning style into the detection process of cognitive traits and vice versa. This leads to a more reliable student model. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The strength of LKT is the specification of a symbolic notation system for alternative logistic regression models that is powerful enough to specify many extant models in the literature and many new models. To demonstrate the generality of LKT, we fit 12 models, some variants of well-known models and some newly devised, to six learning technology datasets. The results indicated that no single learner model was best in all cases, further justifying a broad approach that considers multiple learner model features and the learning context.

Researchers in this field tended to adopt soft computing to defeat the challenges of analytical techniques in order to resolve this evaluation performance problem. Fuzzy logic is utilised to manage the intrinsic uncertainty associated with teachers' subjective assessments and permits reproduction of student modelling in the linguistic form - the same form the human teachers do. The obstacle with existing fuzzy rule-based systems is that the size of the rule base (the number of rules) grows exponentially with the expansion of the number of fuzzy sets included in the rules. This exponential increment in the size of the rule base enlarges the search time and the memory space needed. In this study, a fuzzy rule base compaction (densification) using genetic algorithm is suggested for uncertain measurement of student's performance. The proposed approach consists of three stages: knowledge recovery, coding, and compaction or optimisation.

Therefore, the primary problem to change the efficiency of online courses is to recommend corresponding courses for a certain group of people according to their needs. Learner characteristics are an important aspect of reflecting learner preferences, and learner models are abstract representations and descriptions of learner characteristics. It is necessary to enhance the use of online courses among students; we must build a relatively comprehensive curriculum model. At present, the construction of learner model is mostly based on cognitive level and learning style, ignoring the emotion expressed by learners to the curriculum, and emotion is a very important characteristic of learners. In order to establish a perfect learner model, it is necessary to incorporate learners' aspect emotion into the learner model to make the course recommendation process more accurate. Firstly, based on the attention mechanism long-term and short-term memory network, this paper extracts the learner's aspect emotion to the curriculum from the learner's curriculum review. At the same time, it studies various characteristics, such as demography, cognitive level, motor behavior, and learning style. By establishing a perfect model integrating researchers' emotional state, finally, the complex interaction between learner characteristics and curriculum characteristics is modeled by using deep factor natural decomposition, so as to achieve accurate curriculum recommendation. In this study, the learner's aspect emotion is included in the construction of learner model and enriched and perfected the learner model. It provides a reference for the theoretical research and applied research of learner model and has reference significance. At the same time, combining Deep learning can improve the accuracy of course recommendation, help learners' learning efficiency and personalized learning quality, and also contribute to the long-term development of online platform.

Opening these models to learners identifies for them factors and relations among factors. Open learner models tacitly invite learners to regulate learning. However, contemporary learner models omit data about how learners have and should process information to learn, understand, consolidate and transfer new knowledge and skills. What to do with information opened to learners is opaque. I propose incorporating trace data about learning processes in learner models. Trace data allow generating learning analytics that inform self-regulating learners about potentially productive adaptations to processes they have used to learn.

Despite their remarkable performance improvements, end-to-end models typically require expensive computational cost to show successful performance. To reduce this computational burden, knowledge distillation (KD), which is a popular model compression method, has been used to transfer knowledge from a deep and complex model (teacher) to a shallower and simpler model (student). Previous KD approaches have commonly designed the architecture of the student by reducing the width per layer or the number of layers of the teacher. This structural reduction scheme might limit the flexibility of model selection since the student model structure should be similar to that of the given teacher. To cope with this limitation, we propose a KD method for end-to-end speech recognition, namely TutorNet, that applies KD techniques across different types of neural networks at the hidden representation-level as well as the output-level. For concrete realizations, we firstly apply representation-level knowledge distillation (RKD) during the initialization step, and then apply the softmax-level knowledge distillation (SKD) combined with the original task learning. When the student is trained with RKD, we make use of frame weighting that points out the frames to which the teacher pays more attention.

Constraints in MAST are specified at a low-level of granularity to allow fine-grained diagnosis of the student error. Furthermore, MAST extends CBM to address errors due to misunderstanding of the narrative story. It can locate and highlight keywords that may have been overlooked or misunderstood leading to an error. This is achieved by utilizing the roles and syntaxes of the problem segments and the semantic descriptions of the keywords that are defined through the Natural Language Generation (NLG) methods deployed in the story problem generation. MAST also integrates CBM with scaffolding questions and feedback to provide various forms of help and guidance to the student. This allows the student to discover and correct any errors in his/her solution. The tutoring effect of MAST has been evaluated empirically using different tests (paired samples t-test, normalized knowledge gain, Mann-Whitney U test, and power learning curves). The results demonstrated a positive effect of MAST on improving the exam scores, and the normalized knowledge gain.

On the one hand, a domain specific inference engine and a knowledge representation mechanism are proposed. These are based on a description language based on hypergraphs, and the idea of using conceptual schemes to represent the student's knowledge. As a result, the system is able to simultaneously: (a) represent all potential algebraic solutions to a given word problem; (b) keep track of the student's actions; (c) univocally determine the current state of the resolution process; (d) build a student model; and (e) provide adaptive automatic remediation. On the other hand, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been designed to force the student to follow the sequence of steps described in the Cartesian method. The ITS has been evaluated in an educational environment. The results show significant gains for the experimental group and hence support the use of the ITS in practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In our approach, we enable non-empirical mathematical determination of conditional probabilities, while a priory probabilities are empirically determined based on the knowledge test results. The concepts that are believed to have been learned or not learned represent the evidence. Based on the evidence, it is concluded which concepts need to be re-learned, and which not.

Games offer immersive and fascinating environments that render them a powerful tool for achieving high-quality learning outcomes, like advancing students' education through engaging activities. However, one crucial enhancement is that they should take into consideration important aspects of each individual student and adapt to them accordingly for improving the educational results. Given the above, the present work considers an educational adventure game that offers cognitive-based adaptivity in its educational content and scenarios. More specifically, it adapts both the difficulty level of the educational content and its plot dynamically to the knowledge level and learning needs of each individual student. The adaptation is realized using a fuzzy student model that detects the current cognitive state of the trainee and decides about the way in which the game's plot has to be modified. It determines if its scenario will be dynamically extended or not, aiming to assist the trainee overcome her/his weaknesses and improve her/his educational performance. The gain of this is that through the plot's adaptation, the game motivates the learners/players to be involved actively in the learning process and provides educational content tailored to their knowledge level and weaknesses, enhancing the educational results.

Knowledge tracing is one of the most popular technologies for this purpose, and deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Compared to classical models, such as Bayesian knowledge tracing, which track students' knowledge proficiencies, deep learning-based knowledge tracing is usually modeled to predict students' performances on questions, while ignoring the interpretability of students' knowledge states. However, for many practical applications, such as learning resource recommendation, it would be more helpful if we could explicitly track students' abilities or knowledge proficiencies separately from performance prediction. Researchers in psychometric area already designed cognitive diagnosis solutions to quantify the knowledge states of students in static conditions (e.g., examination), where the educational priors (i.e., factors related to students' learning process) were proved beneficial for student modeling. Inspired by this, we propose dynamic cognitive diagnosis, which integrates the interpretability of educational priors from cognitive diagnosis into deep learning-based knowledge tracing methods. We first discuss and provide evidence of which educational priors can be integrated, including question attributes and interaction function. Then we show the effects of using the educational priors in deep learning-based knowledge tracing from two aspects, i.e., interpretability and accuracy. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we prove that properly chosen priors can enable deep learning-based methods to evaluate students' knowledge states in a manner that is consistent with domain knowledge or human experience.

The neuro-fuzzy synergy allows the diagnostic model to some extent imitate teachers in diagnosing students' characteristics, and equips the intelligent learning environment with reasoning capabilities that can be further used to drive pedagogical decisions depending on the student learning style. The neuro-fuzzy implementation helps to encode both structured and non-structured teachers' knowledge: when teachers' reasoning is available and well defined, it can be encoded in the form of fuzzy rules; when teachers' reasoning is not well defined but is available through practical examples illustrating their experience, then the networks can be trained to represent this experience. The proposed approach has been tested in diagnosing aspects of student's learning style in a discovery-learning environment that aims to help students to construct the concepts of vectors in physics and mathematics. The diagnosis outcomes of the model have been compared against the recommendations of a group of five experienced teachers, and the results produced by two alternative soft computing methods. The results of our pilot study show that the neuro-fuzzy model successfully manages the inherent uncertainty of the diagnostic process; especially for marginal cases, i.e. where it is very difficult, even for human tutors, to diagnose and accurately evaluate students by directly synthesizing subjective and, some times, conflicting judgments.

However, frequent, timely, and personalized feedback is not always possible for immigrants. Online writing support tools can scaffold writing development by providing this feedback, but existing systems provide inadequate support when instructors are inaccessible. In this paper, we show how feedback system design can leverage peer and automated feedback to support mature English Language Learners' (ELL) needs and practices. We identify strong associations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies, highlighting the importance of tasks that activate productive epistemic beliefs. We find learners accurately assessed high-level issues in a peer's writing and are accepting of automated feedback, demonstrating that a platform combining peer-review and machine feedback could promote meaningful discussions. We present the results of our mixed-methods investigation that integrates three sources of information: analysis of learners' psychometric constructs, writing samples to identify error patterns, and participatory design group sessions incorporating human-centred design methods. We synthesize our results into four guidelines derived from seven findings resulting from the investigation of a system that scaffolds writing development for mature immigrant ELLs in the absence of formal instructional support. First, we find that ELLs require a platform to collaboratively iterate through the writing process. Next, we suggest how peer feedback can be enhanced through automated support.

However, in this context, knowledge capacity is restricted, and knowledge variety is rare in different conditions, such as cross-model KD, in which the single teacher KD prohibits the student model from distilling information using cross-domain context. In this study, we aim to train a robust, lightweight student under the supervision of several expert teachers, which provide better instructive guidance compared to a single student-teacher learning framework. To be more specific, we first train five distinct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as teachers for semantic segmentation on several datasets. To this end, several state-of-the-art augmentation transformations have also been utilized in training phase of our teachers. The impacts of such training scenarios are then assessed in terms of student robustness and accuracy.

Text recommendation systems typically classify users and documents into levels, and then match users with documents at the same level. Although this approach can be effective, it has two significant shortcomings. First, the levels assume a standard order of language acquisition and cannot be personalized to the users' learning patterns. Second, recommendation decisions are not transparent because the leveling algorithms can be difficult for users to interpret. We propose a novel method for text recommendation that addresses these two issues. To enhance personalization, an open, editable learner model estimates user knowledge of each word in the foreign language. The documents are ranked by new-word density (NWD) - that is, the percentage of words that are new to the user in the document. The system then recommends documents according to a user-specified target NWD. This design offers complete transparency as users can scrutinize recommendations by reviewing the NWD estimation of the learner model. This article describes an implementation of this method in a mobile app for learners of Chinese as a foreign language. Evaluation results show that users were able to manipulate the learner model and NWD parameters to adjust the difficulty of the recommended documents.

While systems thinking-focused instruction has the potential to benefit student learning, gaps exist in our understanding of students' use of systems thinking to operationalize and model SHS, as well as their metacognitive evaluation of systems thinking. To address this need, we have designed, implemented, refined, and studied an introductory-level, interdisciplinary course focused on coupled human-water, or sociohydrologic, systems. Data for this study comes from three consecutive iterations of the course and involves student models and explanations for a socio-hydrologic issue (n = 163). To analyze this data, we counted themed features of the drawn models and applied an operationalization rubric to the written responses. Analyses of the written explanations reveal statistically-significant differences between underlying categories of systems thinking (F(5, 768) = 401.6, p < 0.05).

At present, monolingual ideologies dominate the language education landscape, particularly disadvantaging non-native speaker teachers (NNSTs), who are proficient multilinguals by default and who might best embody the successful language learner model for emergent multilinguals. Studies on NNSTs, however, have traditionally focused on their status as deficient native speakers instead of exploring their multilinguality, although this has started to change in recent years. This study represents a critical review of empirical studies (n = 84) from 2009-2018 that reflect this change. The review indicates that a growing number of studies have started to document NNSTs' unique affordances and multilingual practices in the classroom globally, that NNSTs can develop a reactive multilingual identity in response to native-speakerism, and that learners, when engaged by researchers, do recognize the multilingual affordances of NNSTs. The study's findings should contribute to the growing body of research on multilingual teacher identity, affordances, and practices, especially as this concerns NNSTs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In essence, KD trains a smaller student model based on a larger teacher model and tries to retain the teacher model's level of performance as much as possible. However, existing KD methods suffer from the following limitations. First, since the student model is smaller in absolute size, it inherently lacks model capacity. Second, the absence of an initial guide for the student model makes it difficult for the student to imitate the teacher model to its fullest. Conventional KD methods yield low performance due to these limitations. In this paper, we propose Pea-KD (Parameter-efficient and accurate Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach to KD. Pea-KD consists of two main parts: Shuffled Parameter Sharing (SPS) and Pretraining with Teacher's Predictions (PTP). Using this combination, we are capable of alleviating the KD's limitations. SPS is a new parameter sharing method that increases the student model capacity. PTP is a KD-specialized initialization method, which can act as a good initial guide for the student. When combined, this method yields a significant increase in student model's performance. Experiments conducted on BERT with different datasets and tasks show that the proposed approach improves the student model's performance by 4.4% on average in four GLUE tasks, outperforming existing KD baselines by significant margins.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,"Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul, South Korea",,,,2022-06-07,WOS:000796435800021,35180258

Empirical studies have verified that the learner models produced by SCNs can usually achieve favorable test performance in practice but more in-depth theoretical analysis of their generalization power would be useful for constructing SCN-based ensemble models with enhanced generalization capacities. In particular, given a collection of independently developed SCN-based learner models, it is useful to select certain base learners that can potentially obtain preferable test results rather than considering all of the base models together, before simply taking their average in order to build an effective ensemble model. In this study, we propose a novel framework for building SCN ensembles by exploring key factors that might potentially affect the generalization performance of the base model. Under a mild assumption, we provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for examining a learner model's generalization error, as well as formulating a novel indicator that contains measurement information for the training errors, output weights, and a hidden layer output matrix, which can be used by our proposed algorithm to find a subset of appropriate base models from a pool of randomized learner models. A toy example of one-dimensional function approximation, a case study for developing a predictive model for forecasting student learning performance, and two large-scale data sets were used in our experiments. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method has some remarkable advantages for building ensemble models. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

While PBL has many strengths, effective PBL requires the tutor to provide a high degree of personal attention to the students, which is difficult in the current academic environment of increasing demands on faculty time. This work describes intelligent tutoring in a collaborative medical tutor for PBL. The main contribution of this work is the development of general domain-independent individual and collaborative student modeling techniques and algorithms for generating tutoring hints in PBL group problem solving, as well as the implementation of these techniques in a collaborative intelligent tutoring system, COMET. COMET is designed to provide an experience that emulates that of live human-tutored medical PBL sessions as much as possible while at the same time permitting the students to participate collaboratively from disparate locations. The system combines concepts from intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) with those from computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL).Medical PBL is particularly challenging due to the complexity of the knowledge involved, the lack of standard, commonly accepted student clinical-reasoning techniques, and the lack of standards for tutoring. This means that we must first attempt to identify prototypical patterns of clinical reasoning and then formalize them to create the clinical reasoning model. Qualitative analysis of PBL tutorial sessions was performed in order to gain insight into the processes involved in PBL, thereby suggesting a framework for generating tutoring feedback. Generating appropriate tutorial actions in COMET requires a model of the students' clinical reasoning for the problem domain. This modeling task is necessarily wrought with uncertainty since we have only a limited number of observations from which to infer each student's level of understanding. Therefore, the system uses Bayesian networks to model individual student clinical reasoning, as well as that of the group. COMET incorporates a multi-modal interface that integrates text and graphics so as to provide a rich communication channel between the students and the system, as well as among students in the group.In order to evaluate the appropriateness and quality of the feedback generated by COMET, the tutoring hints generated by the system were compared with those of experienced human tutors. On average, 74.17% of the human tutors used the same hint as COMET. The results show that COMET's hints agree with the hints of the majority of the human tutors with a high degree of statistical agreement (McNemar test, p = 0.652, Kappa = 0.773). The validity of the modeling approach has been tested with student models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows that, the models are highly accurate in predicting individual student actions. Finally, comparison of learning outcomes shows that student clinical reasoning gains from COMET are significantly higher than those obtained from human tutored sessions (Mann-Whitney, p = 0.011).",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-1-60876-117-3,,,,,,"Thammasat Univ, Sch Dent, Pathum Thani, ThailandAsian Inst Technol, Pathum Thani, Thailand",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000280438300013,

Factors encouraging internationalization include (1) globalization of health care delivery, (2) governmental pressures, (3) improved communication channels, (4) development of a common vocabulary, (5) outcome-based education and standards, (6) staff development initiatives, and (7) competitiveness and commercialization.A three-dimensional model-based on the student (local or international), the teacher (local or international), and the curriculum (local, imported, or international)-offers a range of perspectives for international medical education. In the traditional approach to teaching and learning medicine, local students and local teachers use a local curriculum. In the international medical graduate or overseas student model, students from one country pursue in another country a curriculum taught and developed by teachers in the latter. In the branch-campus model, students, usually local, have an imported curriculum taught jointly by international and local teachers.The future of medical education, facilitated by the new learning technologies and pedagogies, lies in a move from such international interconnected approaches, which emphasize the mobility of students, teachers, and curriculum across the boundaries of two countries, to a transnational approach in which internationalization is integrated and embedded within a curriculum and involves collaboration between a number of schools in different countries. In this approach, the study of medicine is exemplified in the global context rather than the context of a single country. The International Virtual Medical School serves as an example in this regard.",,,,,Conference on Impact of International Medical Graduates on United States and Global Health CareConference on Impact of International Medical Graduates on United States and Global Health Care,"JUL 21-22, 2006JUL 21-22, 2006",ECFMGECFMG,"Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA",105,3,1,0,5,1,109,,,1040-2446,1938-808X,,,,,,,"Int Virtual Med Sch, Dundee DD2 1LR, Scotland",,,,2006-12-01,WOS:000242629200005,17086041

The user model is induced from documents tagged by an expert in a social tagging system. Tags identified with expertise in a domain can be used to identify a corpus of domain documents. That corpus can be fed to an automated process that distills a topic model representation characteristic of the domain. As a learner navigates and reads online material, inferences can be made about the degree to which topics in the target domain have been learned.

To understand learners' playful experiences during gameplay, researchers have applied LA, which focuses on understanding students' in-game behaviour trajectories and personal learning needs during play. However, there is a lack of studies exploring how further research on LA in educational games can be conducted. Only a few analyses have discussed how LA has been designed, integrated, and implemented in educational games. Accordingly, this systematic literature review examined how LA in educational games has evolved. The study findings suggest that: (1) there is an increasing need to consider factors such as student modelling, iterative game design and personalisation when designing and implementing LA through educational games; and (2) the use of LA creates several challenges from technical, data management and ethical perspectives.

Systems using data mining approaches to predict frustration have reported high accuracy, while systems that predict frustration by modeling affective states, not only predict a student's affective state but also the reason for that state.

After successful model calibration and model validation to a German mesoscale catchment, the 'student' model is applied to quantify the impact of regional climate change scenarios on the water budget of the Wiehl drinking water reservoir. The simulation results show that the conceptual 'student model' performs well for both calibration and validation periods. It well represents the variability in water flows at different timescales and therefore has the potential to be used for scenario analysis. The 'student model' shows a comparable reaction to climate change scenarios as sophisticated hydrological catchment models did which were applied to neighboured catchments in North Rhine-Westphalia based on the same underlying parent scenarios. The magnitude of the simulated climate impacts on seasonal water balances and extreme flows indicates that current reservoir management needs to be adjusted to the projected variability of inflows to the reservoir. Despite its simplicity, the 'student model' can have a high value for reservoir management. It well represents the inflow into the reservoir based on available data and provides a reliable estimate of climate change impacts, indicating the necessity of adjustment of the operation rules in the future. At the same time it remains transparent to the model users, offering a simple but realistic training tool for the generation of reservoir inflow time series.

Lecturers may incorrectly identify the students' needs and learning styles based on solely an exam grade or performance in the class. In doing so, students need to be classified using more parameters such as e-learning activities, attendance to virtual live class (for theory and practice) and submission time of the assignment, etc. This study proposes a novel color-labeled student modeling/classification approach using e-learning activities to identify students' learning styles and to monitor students' weekly improvements for individual modules. A novel Student Classification Rate (SCR) formula was created by combining three stages including pre-study stage, virtual_class stage, and virtual_LAB_class stage. In the evaluation part of the SCR, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest algorithms were employed based on two different feature sets for an Object-Oriented Programming Module. Feature set 1 consisted of a combination of e-learning and regular data while the feature set 2 was referred as the combination of the SCR and the regular data. Random Forest yielded the lowest MAE (0.7) by using feature set 2. Also, the majority of the students' (81%) learning styles referred to attending the live virtual class. Students' weekly learning progress was also monitored successfully since the Pearson correlation was measured as 0.78 with the 95% confidence interval between the mean of SCR and lab grades. Additionally, SCR used for two more different modules yielded convincing results in the determination of students' learning styles. The obtained results reveal that the proposed SCR approach has significant potential to correctly classify students, identify students' learning styles, and help the lecturer to monitor the students' weekly progress.

A total of nine teachers working in an academic high school setting were interviewed and their responses were transcribed for analysis and further interpretation. In particular, how they position themselves as EFL teachers in a high school was examined by thematic analysis of the transcripts of interviews on their perceptions of professional identity roles and their own definitions of professional expertise. The results of the current study indicate that Korean EFL teachers in academic high schools are very likely to experience identity conflicts in their positioning as EFL teachers. The major conflicting features of their identity formation are shown in 1) their perceptions of their professional roles as EFL teachers (a role as a foreign language learner model vs. a role as a proficient English expert) and 2) their perceptions of an ideal English education (content-based English education vs. skill-based English education).

Systems thinking (ST) is a promising approach for developing solutions to various problems that society faces and has been acknowledged as a crosscutting concept that should be integrated across educational science disciplines. However, studies show that engaging students in ST is challenging, especially concerning aspects like change over time and feedback. Using computational system models and a system dynamics approach can support students in overcoming these challenges when making sense of complex phenomena. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that examines how 10th grade students engage in aspects of ST through computational system modeling as part of a Next Generation Science Standards-aligned project-based learning unit on chemical kinetics. We show students' increased capacity to explain the underlying mechanism of the phenomenon in terms of change over time that goes beyond linear causal relationships. However, student models and their accompanying explanations were limited in scope as students did not address feedback mechanisms as part of their modeling and explanations. In addition, we describe specific challenges students encountered when evaluating and revising models.

In this regard, using evolutionary learning-based approaches to improve performance in different contexts can greatly influence the appropriate response. There are problems with pedestrian tracking/identification, such as low accuracy for detection, high processing time, and uncertainty in response to answers. Researchers are looking for new processing models that can accurately monitor one's position on the move. In this study, a hybrid algorithm for the automatic detection of pedestrian position is presented. It is worth noting that this method, contrary to the analysis of visible images, examines pedestrians' thermal and infrared components while walking and combines a neural network with maximum learning capability, wavelet kernel (Wavelet transform), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find parameters of learner model. Gradient histograms have a high effect on extracting features in infrared images. As well, the neural network algorithm can achieve its goal (pedestrian detection and tracking) by maximizing learning. The proposed method, despite the possibility of maximum learning, has a high speed in education, and results of various data sets in this field have been analyzed. The result indicates a negligible error in observing the infrared sequence of pedestrian movements, and it is suggested to use neural networks because of their precision and trying to boost the selection of their hyperparameters based on evolutionary algorithms.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2346-075X,,,,,,,,"Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Borujerd Branch, Borujerd, Iran",,,,2022-02-06,WOS:000747406700001,

The implementation, benefits, and outcomes of a layered learner model (LLM) using pharmacy students as pharmacist extenders are described.Summary. In 2011, Cleveland Clinic Florida (CCF) implemented a pharmacy practice model change with the goal of providing all inpatients quality pharmaceutical care while still providing key specialty clinical pharmacy services. An LLM was initiated in which pharmacists supervise pharmacy residents and students in a team format in which students are used as pharmacist extenders. CCF partnered with local and regional colleges of pharmacy to increase the number of advanced pharmacy practice experience student rotations at CCF. Students are given accountability for a specific number of patient beds based on their rotation. They are required to perform medication histories, education on drug indication and adverse effects, discharge counseling, targeted disease counseling, and profile review for drug-related problems for their patients. After the implementation of this model, improvements were observed in Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores (58% versus 70%, respectively), pharmacy interventions per patient per day (0.9 versus 1.4, respectively), and bedside medication delivery capture rate (48% versus 65%, respectively).Conclusion. The implementation of an LLM and partnering with local colleges of pharmacy have improved pharmacy practice at CCF by allowing pharmacy students to work as pharmacist extenders in providing comprehensive pharmacy services to many patients who would not otherwise be reached. This approach has improved HCAHPS scores within the communication of medication domain, increased overall patient interventions, and allowed expansion of CCF's discharge prescription program.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,1,0,35,,,1079-2082,1535-2900,,,,,,,"Cleveland Clin Florida, Weston, FL 33331 USACleveland Clin Florida, Pharm, Weston, FL USACleveland Clin, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",,,,2014-11-01,WOS:000214661900014,25320137

We compare two Bayesian frameworks for that purpose, a standard Bayesian network approach and a more constrained framework that relies on a local independence assumption. Their performance is compared over their respective ability to predict item outcome and through simulations over two data sets.

Hence, this paper embeds feature-based KD modules between a teacher model and a student model.

The establishment and practices associated with adjustment rooms are a local example of broader international trends related to the classification and streaming of schoolchildren. In this study, I argue that the function of classification and the structure of normalisation were embedded in the practices of adjustment rooms. Since a diverse group of children were being placed in ungraded rooms in Los Angeles and were not being properly educated, the adjustment room practice was initiated by identifying educable children from among them. New educational methods, which were gaining attention in progressive education at the time, were thus developed to compensate for educational delays. The goal of the adjustment rooms, which were designed to educate backward and misfit children, was to provide auxiliary education and return them to regular classes in a short period of time. Thus, on the one hand, the adjustment room had the function of promoting normalisation to the standard student model. On the other hand, the adjustment room functioned as a clearing house to categorise children, deciding their fate according to ambiguous criteria of educational potential.

This MEA requires the creation of a model for a client who wants to predict the mode of transportation an individual will likely take to a college campus. Teams were provided with the client's needs and sample data concerning individuals' actual travel mode and travel time, cost, and convenience for various travel modes (walk, bus, or drive). Results Student teams were required to submit their intermediate and final model descriptions in narrative form. Systematic study of their models resulted in identification of four different types of models. Patterns within and across model types were then used to suggest changes to the instructional system.

The count of adaptive learning articles published fluctuated across the decade and peaked in 2015. During this time, the largest concentration of adaptive learning articles appeared inComputers and Education.The majority of the studies occurred in higher education in Taiwan and the United States, with the highest concentration in the computer science discipline. The research focus, adaptive strategies, and adaptive technologies used in these studies were also reviewed. The research was aligned with various instructional design phases, with more studies examining design and development, and implementation and evaluation. For examining adaptive strategies, the authors examined both adaptive sources based on learner model and adaptive targets based on content and instructional model. Learning style was the most observed learner characteristic, while adaptive feedback and adaptive navigation were the most investigated adaptive targets. This study has implications for adaptive learning designers and future researchers regarding the gaps in adaptive learning research. Future studies might focus on the increasing availability and capacities of adaptive learning as a learning technology to assist individual learning and personalized growth.",,,,,,,,,36,0,0,1,1,0,37,,,1042-1629,1556-6501,,,,,,,"Univ N Carolina, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USAUniv New Mexico, Zimmerman Lib, Room 242, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USAOld Dominion Univ, 4301 Hampton Blvd,Suite 4128, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",,,,2020-07-07,WOS:000542828700001,

The article provides initial framing for questions that guided the special issue. Additionally, based on our careful review of each of these articles, some discussion of how selected articles within the issue informed these questions. Specifically, when considering key facets of modeling instruction or design features of modeling curriculum, the studies in the special issue provided insight into productive ways in which teachers engaged students in modeling practices. Further, modeling pedagogies-pedagogies for transforming scientific practices of modeling into students' experience-were reified so that how these pedagogies could be coordinated into classroom instruction was revealed. When characteristic features of students' engagement in modeling were considered, research offered insight into productive model-based learning sequences for K-6 modelers and how students' development of productive epistemologies can evolve differently. Finally, the special issue considered how technology facilitated cognitive processes and/or instructional practices by examining learners' interactions with technology within modeling contexts. In this, instructional sequences using agent-based modeling (ABM) as a central technology are shared. These include the role of ABM in scaling student-modeling experiences beyond individuals to classroom experiences and how ABM can support student investigations of complex phenomenon that is not directly observable, among other affordances.

Dynamic Bayes Nets (DBNs) provide a powerful way to represent and reason about uncertainty in time series data, and are therefore well-suited to model student knowledge. Many general-purpose Bayes net packages have been implemented and distributed; however, constructing DBNs often involves complicated coding effort. To address this problem, we introduce a tool called BNT-SM. BNT-SM inputs a data set and a compact XML specification of a Bayes net model hypothesized by a researcher to describe causal relationships among student knowledge and observed behavior. BNT-SM generates and executes the code to train and test the model using the Bayes Net Toolbox [1]. Compared to the BNT code it outputs, BNT-SM reduces the number of lines of code required to use a DBN by a factor of 5. In addition to supporting more flexible models, we illustrate how to use BNT-SM to simulate Knowledge Tracing (KT) [2], an established technique for student modeling.

To provide students with more sustained and personalized advising, many HEIs turn to online academic advising systems and tools as a way to minimize costs and streamline their advising services. However, in such systems, uncertainty in the learner's parameters is a factor, which makes the decision-making process more difficult. Fuzzy logic, a multivalued logic similar to human thinking and interpretation, is highly suitable and applicable for developing knowledge-based academic advising systems that conserve the inherent fuzziness in learner models. In this paper, an innovative hybrid software infrastructure is presented which integrates expert system, fuzzy reasoning, and ontological tools to provide reliable recommendations to students for the next appropriate learning step. The software comprises a fuzzy logic component that determines the student's interest degree for a specific academic choice accompanied by an ontological model and a conventional rule-based expert system for the composition of personalized learning pathways. In order for the system to recommend the next step of the learning pathway, the output of the fuzzy logic component together with the knowledge that is modeled as part of the multi-facet ontology and the machine perceptible academic advising guidelines expressed as semantic rules interoperate in a dynamic and seamless manner.

The resulting courses generated by the framework are personalized across four patient axes-condition and treatment, comprehension level, learning style based on the VARK (Visual, Aural, Read/write, Kinesthetic) presentation model, and the level of understanding of specific course content according to Bloom's taxonomy. Customizing educational materials along these learning axes stimulates and sustains patients' attention when learning about their conditions or treatment options.

In this paper, we develop a learner modeling and adaptive scaffolding framework for Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling (CTSiM)-an open ended learning environment that supports synergistic learning of science and Computational Thinking (CT) for middle school students. In CTSiM, students have the freedom to choose and coordinate use of the different tools provided in the environment, as they build and test their models. However, the open-ended nature of the environment makes it hard to interpret the intent of students' actions, and to provide useful feedback and hints that improves student understanding and helps them achieve their learning goals. To address this challenge, we define an extended learner modeling scheme that uses (1) a hierarchical task model for the CTSiM environment, (2) a set of strategies that support effective learning and model building, and (3) effectiveness and coherence measures that help us evaluate student's proficiency in the different tasks and strategies.

However, the brown and black spot disease can ruin the appearance and nutritional quality of carrot during the planting. Therefore, the classification of carrot grades has become an essential part, to improve the competitiveness of carrots in the market. Specifically, the detailed grading can greatly contribute to the commercial value of carrots. Traditionally, a feature extraction with classifier mode was generally adopted to detect the carrot appearance, where the manual definition of features was required, leading to time consuming, less accuracy, and erroneous judgement. In this study, a novel network was proposed to solve the problem, based on a lightweight front-end deployment method, the knowledge distillation technique. Teacher and student models were selected, where a teacher model was introduced to guide the training of student model. The model in this network can be used to reduce the number of parameters and running time, while achieve high accuracy. 3 266 high-resolution images of carrot were collected from the sorting machine as the experimental data sets. Four grades were divided, including the normal, curved, black spot and fibrous root, according to the carrot grading standards of Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China NY/T 1983-2011.70% of the dataset was randomly divided into the training sets, whereas, the remaining 30% into test sets. The dataset of carrot was first imported into the network model for training. A teacher model was then introduced, when training to induce a student model, where the teacher model was a large-scale and complex network with many participants, whereas, the student model was a small-scale and streamlined network with a small number of parameters. By inducing training, small models can finally achieve high accuracy. Three teacher models were used, including Resnet34, Resnet50, and Resnet101, in order to guide the training of student model of Resnet18. Correspondingly, the average accuracy of distillation model increased from 94.3% to 94.8%, 95.2%, and 95.8%, respectively. The recognition rate of normal carrot was improved to 100%, where the Resnet18 student model was guided by the Resnet101 teacher model. The recognition rate of normal, black spot and fibrous root increased by about 2%, while, the training time of the model was 11.3 hours. In addition, the recognition accuracies of Resnet50 and Resnet101 teacher model were 96.3% and 96.9% respectively, whereas, the training time of models can be 19.3 hours and 31.3 hours, respectively. The experimental results showed that the recognition rate of distillation model was much higher than that of the traditional model based on feature extraction with classifier. The recognition rate of model can further improved as the increase in the depth of teacher model. Knowledge distillation can perform well from the perspective of training time and arrangement in the model. The training time and deployment of model can be greatly shortened with a tradeoff of accuracy. Consequently, the knowledge distillation model can be used to provide a promising significant support to improve the performance of automatic detection device for the appearance quality of carrots.",,,,,,,,,7,6,0,0,3,0,13,,,1002-6819,,,,,,,,"Correspondence address, Han Zhongzhi, Information College, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao 266109, China.

We examined changes in students' ideas about matter, the coherence of their emerging particle models, and how classroom science discourse influenced students' learning. The study was conducted in two second grade classrooms in a rural Midwestern public school. We worked with the two teachers to help them design modeling activities for students to complement lessons from the Full Option Science System (FOSS) science curriculum the teachers had previously used. Our data sources for student learning included individual interviews with students before and after they completed the set of Modeling in the Primary Grades (MPG) lessons, artifacts created by students during learning such as posters and science notebook entries, and videotapes of MPG lessons. Our findings suggest that second grade students who engaged in MPG model-based inquiry lessons learned to use simple particle models to describe and explain a variety of material phenomena. For example, they could use particle models to account for differences in the appearance and behavior of solids, liquids, and gases and to explain what happens to matter during phase transitions. We also found variations in how MPG teachers structured classroom discourse, and our results suggest that such variations are associated with differences in the coherence of student models.

Typically, a human teaching strategy involves assessing a student's knowledge progress for tailoring the teaching materials to enhance the learning progress. A human teacher can achieve this by tracing a student's knowledge over essential learning concepts in a task. Albeit, such a teaching strategy is not well exploited yet in machine learning as current machine teaching methods tend to directly assess the progress of individual training samples without paying attention to the underlying learning concepts in a learning task. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Knowledge Augmented Data Teaching (KADT), which can optimize a data teaching strategy for a student model by tracing its knowledge progress over multiple learning concepts in a learning task. Specifically, the KADT method incorporates a knowledge tracing model to dynamically capture the knowledge progress of a student model in terms of latent learning concepts. We further develop an attention-pooling mechanism to distill knowledge representations of a student model with respect to class labels, which enables to develop a data teaching strategy on critical training samples. We have evaluated the performance of the KADT method on four different machine learning tasks, including knowledge tracing, sentiment analysis, movie recommendation, and image classification. The KADT method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all these tasks.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

It has advantages in terms of precision and time spent. It is a literature-based approach in which a personalized adaptive learner model (PALM) was constructed. This proposed learner model mines learner's navigational accesses data and finds learner's behavioural patterns which individualize each learner and provide personalization according to their learning styles in the learning process. Fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy inference system a soft computing techniques were introduced to implement PALM.

Therefore, an optimal pedagogical path for one does not necessarily fit the other. Thus, providing an interactive environment tailored to the learner's needs is one of the most important goals of e-learning environments. In our proposal, we make the adaptation of learning our main objective. Our theoretical framework stems from the fact that HCI is a combination of cognitive, behavioral and computer sciences. On the cognitive and behavioural scope, we have opted for adaptive formative assessment so as to identify the learner's competence level and, thereon, to guide the learner to reach the educationally drawn output profile. The aforementioned assessment highlights the learner's real time competence. The latter and the learner's prior knowledge are pivotal elements in adapting the learning process. On the computing scope, this process is carried out via an e-learning system in which the proposed assessment is implemented through Services Oriented Architecture (SOA).In this paper, it would be prominent to individualize the learning path by adopting formative assessment by proposing an adaptive test which offers a selection of optimal items in a sequence taking into account the profile and the progress of the learner. To implement the proposed system, first, we modelled learner and items according to competency based approach (CBA). Then, modelled the formative assessment in an adaptive approach using the Item response theory (IRT), this will provide a series of consecutively selected items. The answer to an item determines the selection of the next one taking into account the previous responses and performances recorded in the learner model.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0949-149X,,,,,,,,"Mohammed Vth Univ Agdal, Mohammadia Sch Engineers EMI, RIME Team, Comp Sci Dept,Lab Comp & Educ, Rabat, Morocco",,,,2014-02-05,WOS:000329811000012,

We assessed 11 students' atomic/molecular-level explanations of real-world phenomena after their participation in a modelling-based PNM unit. All 11 students offered a scientifically acceptable model regarding atomic/molecular behaviour in non-heated solids. Yet, 10 of 11 students expressed the view that, in response to added heat energy, atoms/molecules in a solid increase in movement to a degree beyond what is scientifically accepted. These students attributed a gas-like model of atomic/molecular movement to situations involving a heated solid. Of the students who held two conflicting models of atomic/molecular movement in solids, almost all provided justification for doing so, indicating their holding of the conflicting models was unproblematic. These findings can be interpreted to mean that students may drop constraints of certain scientific representations and apply, assess, or revise models when explaining unfamiliar phenomena. In fact, we believe students may develop conflicting causal models as a result of misperceptions they acquire, in part, during classroom instruction regarding atomic/molecular movement. However, our findings may also be interpreted as an incidence of student model development that may later aid their understanding of a more complex model, one that involves substantial subatomic electron movement to account for heat transfer in solids. Whether or not this is the case remains to be seen.

The purpose of this study is to examine students' views about the OSLM in an e-learning system. Design/methodology/approach This case study was conducted with 40 undergraduate students enrolled in advanced programming and database management system courses. A Likert-type questionnaire and open-ended questions were used to obtain the students' views. System usage data were also analyzed to ensure the richness and diversity of the overall data set. Findings The quantitative data of the students' views were analyzed with descriptive statistics; the results are presented as graphics. The qualitative data of the students' views were examined by content analysis to derive themes. These themes are organized into four subtopics: the students' positive views, their negative views, their improvement suggestions and their preferences about using similar OSLM visualizations in other e-learning systems. The students' subjective views are discussed in the context of their recorded interactions with the system. Research limitations/implications Competition due to seeing peer models was considered by participants both as positive and negative features of the learning system. So, this study revealed that, the ways to combine peer learner models to e-learning systems that promote positive competition without resulting social pressure, still need to be explored. Practical implications By combining open learner models with open peer models, OSLM enhances the learning process in three different ways: it supports self-regulation, encourages competition and empowers self-evaluation. To take advantage of these positive contributions, practitioners should consider enhancing e-learning systems with both own learner and peer model features. Originality/value Despite increasing interest in OSLM studies, several limitations and problems must be addressed such as sparsity of data and lack of study of different contexts and cultures. To date, no published study in this area exists in Turkey. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap by examining OSLM features in an e-learning system from the perspectives of Turkish students by using both their system interaction data and their subjective views.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,2056-4880,,,,,,,,"Gazi Univ, Dept Comp Educ & Instruct Technol, Ankara, TurkeyUniv Pittsburgh, Sch Comp & Informat, Pittsburgh, PA USATrabzon Univ, Dept Comp Educ & Instruct Technol, Trabzon, Turkey",,,,2020-11-19,WOS:000586697700001,

The results show that predictions of learners' learning status (including dropout and retention, student models, and academic achievement) are most frequently discussed in the AI in higher education studies; AI technology is most commonly applied in engineering (including computer courses); AI technologies most often play the role of profiling and prediction in higher education, followed by intelligent tutoring systems and assessment and evaluation.

In this model, the Teacher is capable of presenting teaching material from a Socratic-type Domain model via multiple-choice questions. Since this knowledge is stored in the Domain model in chapters with different levels of complexity, the Teacher is able to present learning material of varying degrees of difficulty to the Students.In our model, we propose that the Teacher will be able to assist the Students to learn the more difficult material. In order to achieve this, he provides them with hints that are relative to the difficulty of the learning material presented. This enables the Students to cope with the process of handling more complex knowledge, and to be able to learn it appropriately.To our knowledge, the findings of this study are novel to the field of intelligent adaptation using Learning Automata (LA). The novelty lies in the fact that the learning system has a strategy by which it can deal with increasingly more complex/difficult Environments (or domains from which the learning as to be achieved). In our approach, the convergence of the Student models (represented by LA) is driven not only by the response of the Environment (Teacher), but also by the hints that are provided by the latter. Our proposed Teacher model has been tested against different benchmark Environments, and the results of these simulations have demonstrated the salient aspects of our model. The main conclusion is that Normal and Below-Normal learners benefited significantly from the hints provided by the Teacher, while the benefits to (brilliant) Fast learners were marginal.

However, applying KD in image regression with a scalar response variable is also important (e.g., age estimation) yet has been rarely studied. Besides, existing KD methods often require a practitioner to carefully select or adjust the teacher and student architectures, making these methods less flexible in practice. To address the above problems in a unified way, we propose a comprehensive KD framework based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), termed cGAN-KD. Fundamentally different from existing KD methods, cGAN-KD distills and transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model via specifically processed cGAN-generated samples. This novel mechanism makes cGAN-KD suitable for both classification and regression tasks, compatible with other KD methods, and insensitive to the teacher and student architectures. An error bound for a student model trained in the cGAN-KD framework is derived in this work, providing a theory for why cGAN-KD is effective as well as guiding the practical implementation of cGAN-KD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 (a subset of ImageNet with only 100 classes) datasets show that the cGAN-KD framework can leverage state-of-the-art KD methods to yield a new state of the art. Moreover, experiments on Steering Angle and UTKFace datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of cGAN-KD in image regression tasks. Notably, in classification, incorporating cGAN-KD into training improves the state-of-the-art SSKD by an average of 1.32% in test accuracy on ImageNet-100 across five different teacher-student pairs.

Given this, some researchers propose a strategy of learning from each student model to replace the traditional teacher-student learning paradigm. Although this way has achieved good results recently, the simple mutual learning between student networks is easy to reach saturation earlier. In this work, we propose a smarter mutual learning method called Smarter Peer Learning (SPL) for online knowledge distillation, which puts forward a weight evaluation mechanism to build a virtual teacher and a novel online distillation framework. The ensemble teacher is constructed by combining the output of student networks through the calculated weight so that students will learn more from the better performance peers in the next stage of the learning.

A wide range of curricular and instructional supports like those embodied in model-based learning (MBL) are necessary for teachers to engage students in the core epistemic commitments of the Next-Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Purpose The main purpose of this study is to inform theory about students' early attempts to engage in the complex kinds of sensemaking experiences inherent in the Framework for K-12 Science Education and the NGSS. Sample Data for this study was collected from 74 10(th) grade students in a high school in the Northwest region of the New England state. Design and Methods An explanatory sequential mixed-method research design was used to examine students' learning outcomes, and to better understand these outcomes in connection to their experiences engaging in modeling in the MBL curriculum unit. Results The results indicated that students' model scores, the number of concepts in models, and the coherence and sophistication of models improved between their initial and final models. Additionally, the following patterns emerged related to ways in which students engaged in the practice of modeling: (1) students attempted to directly represent what they observed, (2) they struggled to pictorially express complex patterns or mechanisms, and (3) students experienced difficulties representing models from a diverse range of perspectives. Conclusion The patterns identified across student models, as well as their reports of experiences related to the MBL unit implementation, provided insight into student experiences with models, while also providing meaningful implications for the refinement of the MBL curriculum unit investigated in this research specifically, while informing approaches MBL curricular units aimed at supporting NGSS implementation efforts more generally.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0263-5143,1470-1138,,,,,,,"Univ Connecticut, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Neag Sch Educ, Storrs, CT 06269 USASouthern Connecticut State Univ, Environm Geog & Marine Sci, New Haven, CT USANo Arizona Univ, Ctr Sci Teaching & Learning, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USAUniv Connecticut, Ctr Land Use Educ & Res CLEAR, Storrs, CT USAUniv Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT USAUniv Connecticut, Inst Environm, Storrs, CT USAUniv Connecticut, Neag Sch Educ, Global Educ, Storrs, CT USAEastern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Educ, Willimantic, CT 06226 USAUniv Maine, Sch Forest Resources, Orono, ME USAUniv Maine, Off Execut Vice President Acad Affairs & Provost, Orono, ME USAUniv Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA",,,,2021-10-02,WOS:000698915000001,

While providing convenience to users, online learning systems also bring troubles to users, who cannot quickly find the resources they are interested in from the huge amount of learning resources. In this paper, we apply deep learning to an English online learning platform and analyze learners and learning contents by clustering algorithm and association rules. Based on this, a content organization system is developed using genetic algorithms, which is applied to the case of this paper to provide learners with personalized learning content. With the hope that the system can be extended to other online learning platforms in the future, three data mining techniques were selected to solve the problems found in the English online learning platform, and we designed how these techniques should be applied to the online learning platform. The first technique is the cluster mining technique, which is used to analyze learners' profiles, classify learners in different categories, provide them with personalized learning content, and organize group learning. The second technique is association rules, which is used to analyze the correlation between learning contents. For the adaptive student-teacher knowledge migration strategy, the teacher model can guide the student model to track online and migrate the task-specific knowledge to the online tracking student model through the network parameters. Finally, a case study is selected and the above design is applied to this case study, and the results are analyzed in detail. The data mining technology is applied to the English online learning platform, and an innovative English learning content organization system is developed.

The existing researchers have proposed many models with lightweight structures, but their performance still has a gap compared with the deep model. A promising approach to optimize the lightweight model is knowledge distillation (KD), which can be viewed as knowledge transfer from the teacher model. However, the existing KD approaches have some issues. On one hand, offline distillation methods usually ignore the interactive learning between the student model and the teacher model. On the other hand, knowledge transfer does not consider instance property. This offline distillation strategy without property perception may not suitable for multiscale, diverse, and complex RS instances and results in a suboptimum training status. In this article, we propose a dynamic interactive learning (DIL) framework for optimizing RS lightweight detectors. First, we propose an instance interaction learning module. It calculates the value of every instance in the batch of the teacher and student prediction by each model's real-time state and instance property. Then according to the DIL thought, we facilitate the low-quality instance to learn from the high-quality one whether it is from the teacher or student model. Moreover, we also propose the instance property perception (IPP) strategy that weighs the distillation knowledge of instances according to their feature, category, and location property. In the proposed DIL framework, both the teacher and student models are trained together and it is cost-free in the testing phase.

Knowledge distillation (KD) is employed to trans-fer the privileged information from the offline teacher to the online student.

The sudden upsurge in digital electronic devices usage, namely personal computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones is unprecedented, which leads to a new wave of both mental and physical health problems among students, for example eye-related illnesses. The overexposure to electronic devices, extended screen time usage and lack of outdoor sunlight have put a consequential strain on the student's ophthalmic health because of their young age and a relative lack of responsibility on their own health. Failure to take appropriate external measures to mitigate the negative effects of this process could lead to common ophthalmic illnesses such as myopia or more serious conditions.

CQACD is based on constructivist principles and encourages the learner to construct knowledge rather than merely receiving knowledge, which has the following characteristics: (a) this system employs a domain ontology with rich semantic relationships to model the basic computer knowledge and build up a concept-centric knowledge model, (b) uses a limited number of 80 input templates with description logics to acquire the intention of questions posed by students, (c) a textual entailment algorithm with semantic technologies is proposed to match the input template and assess the student's contribution to improve the flexibility of the system, and (d) an ontology-driven dialogue management mechanism is proposed, which can quickly form the conversational content and conversational sequence.

Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown promise. However, optimizing DL models requires setting numerous parameters, and demands substantial labeled datasets, which are labor-intensive to create.OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a semi-supervised model that can utilize labeled and unlabeled data to accurately segment kidneys, tumors, and cysts on CT images, even with limited labeled samples.METHODS: An end-to-end semi-supervised learning model named MTAN (Mean Teacher Attention N-Net) is designed to segment kidneys, tumors, and cysts on CT images. The MTAN model is built on the foundation of the AN-Net architecture, functioning dually as teachers and students. In its student role, AN-Net learns conventionally. In its teacher role, it generates objects and instructs the student model on their utilization to enhance learning quality. The semi-supervised nature of MTAN allows it to effectively utilize unlabeled data for training, thus improving performance and reducing overfitting.RESULTS: We evaluate the proposed model using two CT image datasets (KiTS19 and KiTS21). In the KiTS19 dataset, MTAN achieved segmentation results with an average Dice score of 0.975 for kidneys and 0.869 for tumors, respectively. Moreover, on the KiTS21 dataset, MTAN demonstrates its robustness, yielding average Dice scores of 0.977 for kidneys, 0.886 for masses, 0.861 for tumors, and 0.759 for cysts, respectively.CONCLUSION: The proposed MTAN model presents a compelling solution for accurate medical image segmentation, particularly in scenarios where the labeled data is scarce. By effectively utilizing the unlabeled data through a semi-supervised learning approach, MTAN mitigates overfitting concerns and achieves high-quality segmentation results.

Specifically, by taking advantage of the easy-to-hard learning curriculum in deep networks, we first design a groundtruth-free hard-pixel mining module to tell hard and noisy pixels in the teacher's output. Then, we design two self-paced distillation losses, which gradually introduce hard pixels to distill the depth and structure knowledge from the teacher to the compact student network.

This paper proposes an automatic approach for identifying students' learning styles in LMSs as well as a tool that supports teachers in applying this approach. The approach is based on inferring students' learning styles from their behaviour in an online course and was developed for LMSs in general.

Game-based learning was long used for attracting and maintaining students' interest especially in small ages, deploying means such as scoring, timing, scores of peers (i.e., hall of fame), etc. These techniques can provide recognition for high-scoring players, while also developing a sense of safe distance in the impersonal electronic environment for low-scoring players. In addition, constructive feedback on mistakes a player makes can contribute to avoiding similar mistakes in the future, thus achieving better performance in the game, while constructing valuable new knowledge when a knowledge gap is detected.

Natural language processing (NLP) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) may further enhance the educational impact of these simulators.Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a VPS for clinical diagnostic reasoning that integrates interaction in natural language and an ITS. We also aimed to provide preliminary results of a short-term learning test administered on undergraduate students after use of the simulator.Methods: We trained a Siamese long short-term memory network for anamnesis and NLP algorithms combined with Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology for diagnostic hypothesis generation. The ITS was structured on the concepts of knowledge, assessment, and learner models. To assess short-term learning changes, 15 undergraduate medical students underwent two identical tests, composed of multiple-choice questions, before and after performing a simulation by the virtual simulator. The test was made up of 22 questions; 11 of these were core questions that were specifically designed to evaluate clinical knowledge related to the simulated case.Results: We developed a VPS called Hepius that allows students to gather clinical information from the patient's medical history, physical exam, and investigations and allows them to formulate a differential diagnosis by using natural language. Hepius is also an ITS that provides real-time step-by-step feedback to the student and suggests specific topics the student has to review to fill in potential knowledge gaps. Results from the short-term learning test showed an increase in both mean test score (P<.001) and mean score for core questions (P<.001) when comparing presimulation and postsimulation performance.Conclusions: By combining ITS and NLP technologies, Hepius may provide medical undergraduate students with a learning tool for training them in diagnostic reasoning.

ObjectiveThe paper reviews the current research on intelligent learning technology designed to make models of student learning and instruction transparent to teachers, an area we call model-based learning analytics. We intended to gain an insight into the coupling between the knowledge models that underpin the intelligent system and the knowledge used by teachers in their classroom decision making. MethodsUsing a systematic literature review methodology, we first identified 42 papers, mainly from the domain of intelligent tutoring systems and learning analytics dashboards that conformed to our selection criteria. We then qualitatively analysed the context in which the systems were applied, models they used and benefits reported for teachers and learners. Results and ConclusionsA majority of papers used either domain or learner models, suggesting that instructional decisions are mostly left to teachers. Compared to previous reviews, our set of papers appeared to have a stronger focus on providing teachers with theory-driven insights and instructional decisions. This suggests that model-based learning analytics can address some of the shortcomings of the field, like meaningfulness and actionability of learning analytics tools. However, impact in the classroom still needs further research, as in half of the cases the reported benefits were not backed with evidence. Future research should focus on the dynamic interaction between teachers and technology and how learning analytics has an impact on learning and decision making by teachers and students.

The system is composed of a student model and an adaptation model. It collected students' browsing behaviors to update the student model for unobtrusively identifying student cognitive styles through a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLFF). The MLFF was adopted because of its ability on imprecise or incompletely understood data, ability to generalize and learn from specific examples, ability to be quickly updated with extra parameters, and speed in execution making them ideal for real time applications. The system then adaptively recommended learning content presented with a variety of content and interactive components through the adaptation model based on the student cognitive style identified in the student model. The adaptive web interfaces were designed by investigating the relationships between students' cognitive styles and browsing patterns of content and interactive components. Training of the MLFF and an experiment were conducted to examine the accuracy of identifying students' cognitive styles during browsing with the proposed MLFF and the impact of the proposed adaptive web-based system on students' engagement in learning. The training results of the MLFF showed that the proposed system could identify students' cognitive styles with high accuracy and the temporal effects should be considered while identifying students' cognitive styles during browsing. Two factors, the acknowledgment of students' cognitive styles while browsing and the existence of adaptive web interfaces, were used to assign three classes of college freshmen into three groups. The experimental results revealed that the proposed system could have significant impacts on temporal effects on students' engagement in learning, not only for students with cognitive styles known before browsing, but also for students with cognitive styles identified during browsing. The results provide evidence of the effectiveness of the adaptive web-based learning system with students' cognitive styles dynamically identified during browsing, thus validating the research purposes of this study.

However, the existing resource recommendation methods have two problems. On the one hand, they do not make full use of the implicit interaction data of learners in the learning process, i.e., they rarely reflect the comprehensive consideration of learners' interest preferences and cognitive level when describing learners. On the other hand, they are mostly based on collaborative filtering algorithms, using the similarity between learners or videos to recommend, ignoring the impact of semantic relations between videos on the recommendation results. In view of this, we proposed a personalized learning video matching method (IFT-PTransE) based on heterogeneous feature data transfer and knowledge reasoning from two aspects of learning behavior data mining and knowledge graph representation learning. In this method, firstly, a learner model is constructed. By analyzing and quantifying various implicit interaction behavior data of learners, the sparse video scoring matrix is filled as auxiliary data to complete the transfer of target scoring data. Secondly, the semantic close relationship between videos is introduced. PTransE algorithm is used to mine the multi-path relationship between entities. All entity relationships are embedded into the low dimensional vector space, so that the semantic similarity between videos can be calculated using the distance between vectors. Finally, video score similarity and semantic similarity between frequencies are fused. video sorting is performed based on the improved collaborative filtering algorithm and then recommend the top N videos to the students. Through simulation and analysis, the effectiveness of this method in personalized video matching is proved. This method makes up for the shortcomings of collaborative filtering algorithm in using implicit information, enhances the recommendation effect at the semantic level, and solves the data sparse and cold start problems to a certain extent.

The temporal trajectories are consequently likely to, besides showing children's knowledge development, be indicative of children's regulation. Therefore, we explore clusters of these trajectories to further identify failure in children's self-regulated learning (SRL) and potential support needs. We propose a data-driven approach to cluster 354 trajectories of 134 5th graders learning three skills with different complexity. The resulting 9 clusters were interpreted using practice accuracy and effort as indicators of regulation of practice behaviour and prior and post-knowledge and learning gain as indicators of knowledge development. The differences between clusters regarding these indicators signal there are different levels of SRL failure and, consequently, different SRL support needs: high accuracy and knowledge development indicate minimal support needs, whereas clusters with low accuracy, showing no knowledge development, indicate extensive SRL support needs.

To this end, the number of forty-one systems, published since 2010, has been chosen. The 65.85% of these systems emerged from qualitative research journals papers, whereas the rest derived from significant international conferences. In addition, the 43.9% of selected systems has been developed using well-known web 2.0 technologies.

This paper provides significant information to instructors, researchers and software developers of SN-learning environments, concerning either already existing social networking platforms serving as tutoring tools or intelligent e-learning systems incorporating social characteristics. Developing high quality software is vital, as in current days, learning communities are computer-literate and have rising expectations for the systems they use. Moreover, this paper can be used as a guideline for making decisions about the techniques and tutoring styles that should be adopted when designing intelligent social networking-based educational systems. One major conclusion is that tutoring systems that have been developed on well-known social networking platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Elgg etc) tend to have placed the emphasis on social features, while they do not provide yet learner-centered education in terms of adaptive and personalized learning.

Although serious games are often deployed as stand-alone solutions, they can also serve as entry points into a comprehensive training pipeline in which content is delivered via different media to rapidly scale immersive training and education for mass audiences. The present paper introduces a new paradigm for more effective and scalable training and education called transmedia learning. Transmedia learning leverages several new media trends including the peer communications of social media, the scalability of massively openonline course (MOOCs), and the design of transmedia storytelling used by entertainment, advertising, and commercial game industries to sustain audience engagement. Transmedia learning is defined as the scalable system of messages representing a narrative or core experience that unfolds from the use of multiple media, emotionally engaging learners by involving them personally in the story. In the present paper, we introduce the transmedia learning paradigm as offering more effective use of serious games for training and education. This approach is consistent with the goals of international organizations implementing approaches similar to those described by the Army Learning Model (ALM) to deliver training and education to Soldiers across multiple media. We discuss why the human brain is wired for transmedia learning and demonstrate how the Simulation Experience Design Method can be used to create transmedia learning story worlds for serious games. We describe how social media interactions and MOOCs may be used in transmedia learning, and how data mining social media and experience tracking can inform the development of computational learner models for transmedia learning campaigns. Examples of how the U.S. Army has utilized transmedia campaigns for strategic communication and game-based training are provided. Finally, we provide strategies the reader can use today to incorporate transmedia storytelling elements such as Internet, serious games, video, social media, graphic novels, machinima, blogs, and alternate reality gaming into a new paradigm for training and education: transmedia learning.

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,2624-8212,,,,,,,"UCL, IOE UCLs Fac Educ, Dept Culture Commun & Media, UCL Knowledge Lab, London, England",,,,2023-02-10,WOS:000917935900001,36304958

RemixIT is based on a continuous self-training scheme in which a pre-trained teacher model on out-of-domain data infers estimated pseudo-target signals for in-domain mixtures. Then, by permuting the estimated clean and noise signals and remixing them together, we generate a new set of bootstrapped mixtures and corresponding pseudo-targets which are used to train the student network. Vice-versa, the teacher periodically refines its estimates using the updated parameters of the latest student models. Experimental results on multiple speech enhancement datasets and tasks not only show the superiority of our method over prior approaches but also showcase that RemixIT can be combined with any separation model as well as be applied towards any semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation task.

To address this issue, we propose a learner modelling mechanism for monitoring learners' actions when constructing/exploring models by modelling sequences of actions reflecting different strategies in solving a task. This is based on a modified version of case-based reasoning for problems with multiple solutions.

The system suggests adaptations and the student also submits his/her adaptation preference. When the student preference opposes the system suggestion, the student then negotiates with the system to reach an agreement of adaptation. A negotiation-based adaptive learning system (NALS) is implemented to support the generation of personalized adaptive learning sequences by system negotiations with students regarding assessments of learning performance (i.e. negotiated open student model) of the current content and choices of the next learning content (i.e. negotiation of adaptation). Students require two metacognitions in deciding adaptive learning sequences: self-assessment for evaluating their understanding of the current content and regulation for choosing appropriate learning content. Negotiated open student model are used for assist student self-assessment and negotiation of adaptation are used for assist student regulation of content choices. An experiment was conducted to compare a system-controlled adaptive learning system (SALS, adaptivity), a user-controlled adaptive learning system (UALS, adaptability), and a NALS. The results revealed that NALS promoted better metacognitions in student calibration (i.e. self-assessment) accuracy and learning content choices (i.e. regulation). Preliminary evidences also showed that NALS promoted better student performance in a delay test. The results further suggested that students with poor calibration accuracy and inappropriate content choices were not suitable to use UALS and were suitable to use SALS. The NALS can also be used for training students to make appropriate adaptation for learning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently there has been increased attention on learning explanatory models as a key to conceptual understanding. Science educators also struggle with how to teach students scientific thinking practices, and sometimes this goal is seen as being in competition with content goals for conceptual understanding. In this study we ask whether whole class discussion can contribute to both of these goals at the same time and whether there are ways that a teacher can support this. We describe the results of a case study of an experienced teacher leading modeling discussions in a series of three middle school life sciences classes. A qualitative microanalysis of the videotaped whole class discussions led to the identification of a variety of modeling processes operating across the lessons at two different time scale levels. These include model competition, in which students compare and evaluate their models, and model evolution, in which the models go through stepwise evaluation and improvement. The latter process involves a smaller time scale pattern of model generation, evaluation, and modification cycles. All of these processes are similar to those found in recent studies of practices of expert scientists. Implications from the case study suggest that: (1) A teacher need not be limited to the two opposing interaction styles of Open Discussion vs. Authoritative lecture. Rather, there are there intermediate discussion styles between these that involve co-construction and cognitive scaffolding; (2) It is possible to start from student-generated models that conflict with the target model in a number of ways, and still arrive at the target model for the lesson through discussion. Processes of model competition and disconfirmation, as well as model evolution, both supported by the teacher's cognitive scaffolding, were central in this accomplishment; (3) In doing so, it is possible for a teacher to foster student modeling practices, as a type of scientific thinking, at the same time that they are teaching science content, by scaffolding the two levels of model construction processes identified.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,,2504-284X,,,,,,,"Univ Concepcion, Dept Curriculum & Instrucc, Concepcion, ChileUniv Massachusetts, Coll Educ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,,,2019-07-23,WOS:000682610700001,

Personalised training may proffer a better solution for heterogeneous workers in the construction sector. To understand the rationale of personalised training, this study formulated a learner model that can capture and evaluate the learning abilities of individual workers. Methodically, a survey on 170 construction workers was conducted, and evidenced that they were heterogeneous in safety training motivation, established knowledge, and emotions during the knowledge acquisition process; and were vulnerable to the model effect and convenience effect during the knowledge application process. The results also showed that workers generally perceived safety training as a mandatory requirement, rather than inherently motivated; emotional changes was the most influencing factor in the knowledge acquisition process; about 40% of the workers were strongly vulnerable to the model effect and convenience effect; and 18% of the workers needed to improve their ability of knowledge acquisition and knowledge application. The correlation analysis and t-test indicated that age, year of experience, trade, project type, organisation type and site environment influenced workers' learning characteristics and abilities; which lead to the varied levels of safety understanding, awareness and performance.

To this end, computerized adaptive learning (CAL) systems are developed. A popular method to track the development of student ability and item difficulty, in CAL systems, is the Elo Rating System (ERS). The ERS allows for dynamic model parameters by updating key parameters after every response. However, drawbacks of the ERS are that it does not provide standard errors and that it results in rating variance inflation. We identify three statistical issues responsible for both of these drawbacks. To solve these issues we introduce a new tracking system based on urns, where every person and item is represented by an urn filled with a combination of green and red marbles. Urns are updated, by an exchange of marbles after each response, such that the proportions of green marbles represent estimates of person ability or item difficulty. A main advantage of this approach is that the standard errors are known, hence the method allows for statistical inference, such as testing for learning effects.

Most adaptive testing proposals are based on dichotomous models, where he student answer can only be considered either correct or incorrect. In the work described here, a polytomous model has been used, i.e., answers can be given partial credits. Thus, models are more informative and diagnosis is more efficient.

The meta-teacher is trained in a bi-level optimization manner to learn the ability to supervise the PA detectors learning rich spoofing cues. The bi-level optimization contains two key components: 1) a lower-level training in which the meta-teacher supervises the detector's learning process on the training set; and 2) a higher-level training in which the meta-teacher's teaching performance is optimized by minimizing the detector's validation loss. Our meta-teacher differs significantly from existing teacher-student models because the meta-teacher is explicitly trained for better teaching the detector (student), whereas existing teachers are trained for outstanding accuracy neglecting teaching ability. Extensive experiments on five FAS benchmarks show that with the proposed MT-FAS, the trained meta-teacher 1) provides better-suited supervision than both handcrafted labels and existing teacher-student models; and 2) significantly improves the performances of PA detectors.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,0,15,,,0162-8828,1939-3539,,,,,,,"Commun Univ China, Neurosci & Intelligent Media Inst NIMI, Beijing 100024, Peoples R ChinaNorthwestern Polytech Univ, Xian 710072, Peoples R ChinaUniv Oulu, Ctr Machine Vis & Signal Anal, Oulu 90014, FinlandBeijing Kwai Technol Co Ltd, Beijing 102600, Peoples R ChinaMiningLamp Technol, Beijing 100000, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci CASIA, Ctr Biometr & Secur Res CBSR, Inst Automat, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit NLPR, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci UCAS, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Ctr Artificial Intelligence & Robot, Hong Kong Inst Sci & Innovat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Beijing Kwai Technol Co LtdMiningLamp TechnolUniv Chinese Acad Sci UCAS,,,2022-09-26,WOS:000853875300035,34156938

This study builds a student model based on Learning Analytics (LA), using data collected from 1399 students that used a VRTS for the maintenance training of lineworkers in 329 courses carried out from 2008 to 2016. By employing several classifiers, the model allows discriminating between trained and untrained students in different maneuvers using three minimum evaluation proficiency scores.

The model also involves the exploration of the trainees' trace data through a visualization tool to pose nonobservable behavioral variables related to displayed errors. The results show that the model can discriminate between trained and untrained students, the Random Forest algorithm standing out.

To address this problem, we study a novel decoding knowledge transfer strategy, and propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MT-KD) network for Tacotron2 TTS model. The idea is to pre-train two Tacotron2 TTS teacher models in teacher forcing and scheduled sampling modes, and transfer the pre-trained knowledge to a student model that performs free running decoding. We show that the MT-KD network provides an adequate platform for neural TTS training, where the student model learns to emulate the behaviors of the two teachers, at the same time, minimizing the mismatch between training and run-time inference. Experiments on both Chinese and English data show that MT-KD system consistently outperforms the competitive baselines in terms of naturalness, robustness and expressiveness for in-domain and out-of-domain test data.

This joint extraction method can extract both course knowledge entities and their relationships from the unstructured text of online courses, thus alleviating the problem of error propagation. On the other hand, since some parameters in the joint model can be shared by the entity identification task and the relationship classification task, this helps the model to capture the interaction between the two subtasks. Similar courses are judged based on the extracted course knowledge points, while course knowledge chains are generated based on the relationships between course knowledge points. In terms of user learning behavior, by analyzing user online learning behavior data, this paper uses five variables, namely the number of learning hours, the number of discussions, the number of visits, the number of task points completed, and the number of learning courses, to judge and cluster user similarity using an information entropy-based learner behavior weight assignment method. Based on the course knowledge map, this paper firstly constructs a learner model with four dimensions of basic learner profile, cognitive level, learning style, and historical learning records. Secondly, it predicts the target knowledge points of learners based on their learning data using the Armorial algorithm and maps them in the knowledge map, then uses natural language processing related techniques to find the conceptual similarity between knowledge points and proposes a deep recommendation strategy based on the knowledge graph correlations. At the same time, the recommended courses based on learners' behavioral data are more relevant and accurate, which greatly improves learners' efficiency and satisfaction in the learning process.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0218-1266,1793-6454,,,,,,,"Hebei Univ, Sch Educ, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R ChinaUniv South Australia, Sch Educ, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",,,,2022-11-21,WOS:000881792000001,

In Computer Science Education (CSE), Adaptive Learning Systems (ALS) can provide students with customized lessons, exercises, and assessments based on their previous knowledge, strengths, and weaknesses. Some literature reviews focus on adaptive learning techniques, but none specifically analyze the methods used in adaptive systems in CSE. Our overall objective is to identify the computing techniques that are implemented within ALS to provide adaptive computer education in higher education. We conducted a scoping review (SR) based on the Guidelines for performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, defining six research questions and a search string. We performed searches in four databases, retrieving 512 documents. After applying the selection criteria, we selected 29 works. The results present quantitative and qualitative data from those 29 studies. Most research has used adaptive learning in programming education (12 articles) and databases (9 papers). Nine articles used learning styles as the core of adaptation, with the Felder-Silverman model being used by seven of them. The most commonly used approach was the rule-based system approach built by experts within the proposal, which was used in 17.24% of the articles. Clustering, collaborative filtering, fuzzy logic, and K-NN were used in 10.34% of the proposals. The positive aspect of delivering adaptive content was pointed out in seven articles. As for negative aspects, the problem of lack of student engagement was mentioned in four articles. This study discusses the application of dynamic and static models based on learning styles (LS) and the challenges involved in their use. Additionally, another aspect pointed out is that it is crucial to carefully consider pedagogical aspects in learning systems and have mixed development teams. The study also discusses student motivation and the use of gamification elements as a strategy to engage students in electronic learning systems. Finally, the results also indicate that the level of student knowledge is typically represented by a student model (SM), and the growing trend is the use of hybrid SMs. The research identified the most studied areas in ALS in CSE, such as computer programming and databases. The most common techniques used in ALS were rule-based systems built by experts, fuzzy logic, and clustering. The most common feature of ALS identified was learning resources, and the majority of studies focused on investigating the impact of system accuracy. This research can help researchers design better adaptive learning systems and understand challenges that need to be addressed.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1360-2357,1573-7608,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil",,,,2023-09-25,WOS:001062137400003,

Despite the frequent argument that LADs are useful to support target users and their goals to monitor and act upon the information provided, little is known about LADs' theoretical underpinnings and the alignment (or lack thereof) between LADs intended outcomes and the measures used to evaluate their implementation. However, this knowledge is necessary to illuminate more efficient approaches in the development and implementation of LAD tools. Guided by the self-regulated learning perspective and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, this systematic literature review addressed this gap by examining whether and how learner-facing LAD's target outcomes align with the domain measures used to evaluate their implementations. Out of the 1297 papers retrieved from 15 databases, 28 were included in the final quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results suggested an intriguing lack of alignment between LADs' intended outcomes (mostly cognitive domain) and their evaluation (mostly affective measures). Based on these results and on the premise that LADs are designed to support learners, a critical recommendation from this study is that LADs' target outcomes should guide the selection of measures used to evaluate the efficacy of these tools. This alignment is critical to enable the construction of more robust guidelines to inform future endeavours in the field.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicThere has been an increased interest and investment in learning analytics dashboards to support learners as end-users.Learner-facing learning analytics dashboards are designed with different purposes, functionalities and types of data in an attempt to influence learners' behaviour, achievement and skills.What this paper addsThis paper reports trends and opportunities regarding the design of learner-facing learning analytics dashboards, contexts of implementation, as well as types and features of learner-facing learning analytics dashboard studies.The paper discusses how affect and motivation have been largely overlooked as target outcomes in learner-facing learning analytics dashboards.Implications for practice and/or policyBased on the evidence gathered through the review, this paper makes recommendations for theory (eg, inclusion of motivation as an important target outcome).The paper makes recommendations related to the design, implementation and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards.The paper also highlights the need for further integration between learner-facing learning analytics dashboards and open learner models.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,0,14,,,0007-1013,1467-8535,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Sch Teaching & Learning, Gainesville, FL USAUniv Florida, Sch Human Dev & Org Studies Educ, Gainesville, FL USA",,,,2021-05-26,WOS:000647887900001,

Existing works only consider intermediate layer feature maps between the same layers and ignore valuable information across layers, which results in the lack of appropriate cross-layer supervision in detail and the process of learning. Besides, this manner provides insufficient supervision information to supervise the learning of student, since it fails to construct a qualified teacher. In this work, we propose a Deep Cross-layer Collaborative Learning network (DCCL) for OKD, which efficiently exploits fruitful knowledge of peer student models by keeping appropriate intermediate cross-layer supervision. Specifically, each student gradually integrates its own features at different layers for feature matching, so as to effectively utilize features in low and high levels for learning more composite knowledge. Moreover, we assign a collaborative knowledge learning strategy, in which a qualified teacher is established via fusing the features of last convolution layers for enhancing high-level representation. In this way, all student models continuously transfer the rich teacher's internal representation as well as capture its dynamic growth process, and in turn assist the learning of the fusion teacher to further supervise students. In the experiments, our proposed DCCL has shown great generalization ability with various backbone models on CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet, and also demonstrated superior performance against mainstream OKD works.

Paper-and-pencil tests were used both before and after the study to evaluate students' development of specific modeling skills. The data analysis followed both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings of the present study indicate that (i) the development of modeling ability was effectively enhanced through the modeling-based approach, since, after instruction, students were able to transfer those aspects to unfamiliar contexts; in contrast, the more traditional worksheet-based approach did not promote the development of the same aspects of the modeling skill; and (ii) Stagecast Creator enabled students to construct, test, revise and validate dynamic computer-based models of a marine ecosystem through building, testing and debugging complex rules, routines and programs for simulating multiple behaviours and processes of marine species.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,0,24,,,0266-4909,1365-2729,,,,,,,"Univ Cyprus, Dept Educ Sci, Learning Sci Grp, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",,,,2007-04-01,WOS:000245504800006,

Knowledge distillation (KD) is one of the effective ways to perform model compression and inference acceleration. But the final student models remain parameter redundancy. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel approach, called Variational Bayesian Group-level Sparsification for Knowledge Distillation (VBGS-KD), to distill a large teacher network into a small and sparse student network while preserving accuracy. We impose the sparsity-inducing prior on the groups of parameters in the student model, and introduce the variational Bayesian approximation to learn structural sparseness, which can effectively prune most part of weights. The prune threshold is learned during training without extra fine-tuning. The proposed method can learn the robust student networks that have achieved satisifying accuracy and compact sizes compared with the state-of-the-arts methods.

First, this paper proposes an online SSL (small sample learner) model for college students to integrate healthy emotional factors. The characteristics of learners are divided into three categories: basic characteristics of learners, characteristics of behavioral factors, and characteristics of emotional factors, and the problem of solving mapping functions is transformed into the problem of solving kernel functions. Second, a novel curriculum recommendation model integrating healthy emotional factors is proposed, which fully considers the influence of user comments on similarity and transforms the similarity of users in the overall score of the project into the similarity of users in the emotional tendency of the special attributes of the project.

However, most of the models do not consider two typical situations in real-life classrooms. The first is that teachers develop their own questions for online formative assessment. Therefore, there are a huge number of possible questions, each of which is answered by only a few students. Second, online formative assessment often involves open-ended questions that students answer in writing. These types of questions in online formative assessment are highly valuable. However, analyzing the responses automatically can be a complex process. In this paper, we address these two challenges. We analyzed 621,575 answers to closed-ended questions and 16,618 answers to open-ended questions by 464 fourth-graders from 24 low socioeconomic status (SES) schools. Using regressors obtained from linguistic features of the answers and an automatic incoherent response classifier, we built a linear model that predicts the score on an end-of-year national standardized test. We found that despite answering 36.4 times fewer open-ended questions than closed questions, including features of the students' open responses in our model improved our prediction of their end-of-year test scores.

Therefore, emotion recognition is becoming very relevant in educational scenarios, but there is no standard method for predicting students' affects. However, physiological signals have been widely used in educational contexts. Some physiological signals have shown a high accuracy in detecting emotions because they reflect spontaneous affect-related information, which is fresh and does not require additional control or interpretation. Most proposed works use measuring equipment for which applicability in real-world scenarios is limited because of its high cost and intrusiveness. To tackle this problem, in this work, we analyse the feasibility of developing low-cost and nonintrusive devices to obtain a high detection accuracy from easy-to-capture signals. By using both inter-subject and intra-subject models, we present an experimental study that aims to explore the potential application of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to predict the concentration state from 4 commonly used physiological signals, namely heart rate, breath rate, skin conductance and skin temperature. We also study the effect of combining these four signals and analyse their potential use in an educational context in terms of intrusiveness, cost and accuracy. The results show that a high accuracy can be achieved with three of the signals when using HMM-based intra-subject models.

Despite the potential therapeutic benefits of primer vaccine dosage regimens, public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine booster dose (VBD) acceptance and hesitancy vary among various sub-group populations. This study investigates COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance and compares the multi-dimensional potential factors influencing VBD acceptance and hesitancy among university teachers and the student community in Bangladesh. MethodsThis web-based cross-sectional study employed an anonymous, validated, and self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire items were adopted from a theoretical analysis of the recent relevant literature. The questionnaire was deployed in an on-line-enabled format (Google form) and conveniently distributed to 685 teachers and 990 students between 15th June, 2022 and 15th August, 2022 which resulted in the participation of 1250 (505 teachers vs.745 students) total respondents (response rate 73.72% vs. 75.25%) from various universities in Bangladesh. A non-parametric analytical tool (binary logistic regression) was applied to rationalize the study objectives and a Chi-squared test was performed to estimate the booster- hesitant risky group. ResultsThe pooled COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance rates were 84.6% (95% CI 81.587.7) and 67.2% (95% CI 63.870.6) for teachers and students in the university academic community, respectively. In employing a binary logistic regression, this study revealed that out of twelve (12)multi-dimensional key predictors, equal safety, risk-benefit ratio, and variant control had a significant positive association with VBD acceptance in both sets (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, and p = 0.005, respectively). Varied effects were found for several predictors; post-vaccination side effects had a significant negative association (p = 0.020) and community protection had significant positive association (p = 0.034) with vaccine booster dose acceptance in the teachers community while these variables were insignificant in the students cohort. Trust had a highly significant positive association (p = 0.000);communication and academic attainment had significant positive associations (p = 0.033 and 0.024, respectively) with VBD acceptance in the students cohort, while these predictors were insignificant in the teachers community. Women were more likely to receive a third dose of the vaccine (OR = 1.4 vs. 0.9 between teacher and student model); however, no significant association between gender and booster vaccine acceptance was found in a comparative Chi-squared model. Therefore, statistically, the booster vaccine-hesitant risky group was not found to implicate the massive booster vaccine drive among the university academic community. ConclusionsCOVID-19 booster vaccine acceptability among the student cohort was slightly lower than pre-roll-out intent. The teacher community was more inclined to get booster vaccinated. Moreover, differences were found between the multi-dimensional potential factors associated with VBD acceptance among teachers and students in university settings. This study explicitly confirmed positive attitudes toward the safety, health benefits, and variants control of the COVID-19 VBD under any circumstances.Post-vaccination side effect concern was found to be a barrier to administering booster shots and a reason for booster skepticism. Tailored communication and health education interventions need to be adopted to improve the public awareness of booster vaccine consequences, and limit booster skepticism.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,"Jashore Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Pharm, Jashore, BangladeshUniv Rajshahi, Dept Mkt, Rajshahi, BangladeshUniv Rajshahi, Dept Pharm, Rajshahi, BangladeshUniv Rajshahi, Inst Educ & Res, Rajshahi, BangladeshRabindra Univ, Shahjadpur, Bangladesh",Jashore Univ Sci & TechnolRabindra Univ,,,2023-05-31,WOS:000970963500133,37053270

Although students believe that highlighting and subsequent review of the highlights will further their educational goals, the psychological literature provides little evidence of benefits. Nonetheless, a student's choice of text for highlighting may serve as a window into her mental state-her level of comprehension, grasp of the key ideas, reading goals, and so on. We explore this hypothesis via an experiment in which 400 participants read three sections from a college-level biology text, briefly reviewed the text, and then took a quiz on the material. During initial reading, participants were able to highlight words, phrases, and sentences, and these highlights were displayed along with the complete text during the subsequent review. Consistent with past research, the amount of highlighted material is unrelated to quiz performance. Nonetheless, highlighting patterns may allow us to infer reader comprehension and interests. Using multiple representations of the highlighting patterns, we built probabilistic models to predict quiz performance and matrix factorization models to predict what content would be highlighted in one passage from highlights in other passages. We find that quiz score prediction accuracy reliably improves with the inclusion of highlighting data (by about 1%-2%), both for held-out students and for held-out student questions (i.e., questions selected randomly for each student), but not for held-out questions. Furthermore, an individual's highlighting pattern is informative of what she highlights elsewhere. Our long-term goal is to design digital textbooks that serve not only as conduits of information into the reader's mind but also allow us to draw inferences about the reader at a point where interventions may increase the effectiveness of the material.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0364-0213,1551-6709,,,,,,,"Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USAUniv Massachusetts, Coll Informat & Comp Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USAGoogle Res, Mountain View, CA USA",,,,2020-12-16,WOS:000595252500001,33191526

During the experiment, students' learning experience was monitored by collecting their eye-tracking data, learning profiles, academic performances, and time to complete the activity. We applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between eye-gaze features and students' learning performance. The obtained results suggest that combining eye-gaze tracking with learning traces and behaviour attributes may support an accurate prediction of students' learning performance.

The study's objective is to compare the strength of associations between standardized patient (SP) satisfaction with simulated genetic counseling sessions and student skill use during the sessions, as reported by SPs and students. We hypothesized that (1) Both SP- and student-reported skill use will be significantly associated with SP satisfaction ratings during the baseline simulation and (2): SP ratings of student skill use will show a stronger relationship to SP satisfaction than student self-rating of skill use. Sixty genetic counseling students and recent graduates (referred to as students) from accredited U.S. and Canadian programs participated in the study and completed a baseline virtual-simulated genetic counseling session. Both students and SPs completed post-session questionnaires about communication skill use (a 22-item checklist) and SPs completed a satisfaction questionnaire based on the session (a 14-item Likert scale). Multilevel regression models assessed associations between SP satisfaction during the baseline session and SP- or student-reported skill use. SP satisfaction was significantly associated with skill use reported by both SPs and students, but the model based on SP report explained a higher proportion of the variance in SP satisfaction than student-reported skill use (SP model fixed effects R-2 = 27%, adjusted R-2 = 21%; vs. student model R-2 = 7%, adjusted R-2 = -2%). For both the SP and student models, use of more skills from the LISTEN domain (which focused on eliciting the patient's perspective) was associated with higher SP satisfaction, while other skill category domains were not. These findings support the SP satisfaction measure as sensitive to variation in student performance of key communication skills, especially those eliciting the patient's perspective. Moreover, SP assessment of session satisfaction can be a useful assessment of student communication performance and a meaningful proxy for actual patient satisfaction.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1059-7700,1573-3599,,,,,,,"Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Hlth Behav & Soc, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",,,,2023-01-03,WOS:000900016000001,36537339

Although the convolutional neural network has great potential to automate the segmentation task, most existing deep learning-based infection segmentation methods require fully annotated ground-truth labels for training, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper proposed a novel weakly supervised segmentation method for COVID-19 infections in CT slices, which only requires scribble supervision and is enhanced with the uncertainty-aware self-ensembling and transformation consistent techniques. Specifically, to deal with the difficulty caused by the shortage of supervision, an uncertainty-aware mean teacher is incorporated into the scribble-based segmentation method, encouraging the segmentation predictions to be consistent under different perturbations for an input image. This mean teacher model can guide the student model to be trained using information in images without requiring manual annotations. On the other hand, considering the output of the mean teacher contains both correct and unreliable predictions, equally treating each prediction in the teacher model may degrade the performance of the student network. To alleviate this problem, the pixel level uncertainty measure on the predictions of the teacher model is calculated, and then the student model is only guided by reliable predictions from the teacher model. To further regularize the network, a transformation-consistent strategy is also incorporated, which requires the prediction to follow the same transformation if a transform is performed on an input image of the network. The proposed method has been evaluated on two public datasets and one local dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective than other weakly supervised methods and achieves similar performance as those fully supervised. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we give a mathematically rigorous treatment of the problem in the framework of Bayesian decision theory. To quantify the opportunities for learning, we assume that the learning tasks that yield the most information about the current skills of the student, while being desirable for measurement in their own right, would also be among those that are efficient for learning. Indeed, optimization of the expected information gain appears to naturally avoid tasks that are exceedingly demanding or exceedingly easy as their results are predictable and thus uninformative. Still, tasks that are efficient for learning may be experienced as too challenging, and the resulting failures can lower motivation. Therefore, in addition to quantifying the expected informational benefit for learning of any prospective task to be presented next, we also model the expected motivational cost of its presentation, measured simply as the estimated probability of failure in our example model. We propose a learner-friendly adaptation algorithm that chooses the learning tasks by optimizing the expected benefit divided by the expected cost. We apply this algorithm to a Rasch-like student model implemented within a real-world application and present initial results of a pilot experiment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The results indicate that: the most used learner characteristic is learning style even though the use of learning knowledge is on the rise; there is a rise in the use of machine learning algorithms in learner modelling; learning content is the most common target for adaptation; rules is the most utilized method in the adaptation model; and most adaptive online learning have not been evaluated in terms of learning.

In SRL, monitoring plays a critical role in generating internal feedback and thus adopting appropriate regulations. However, students may have poor SRL processes and performance due to their poor monitoring. Researchers have suggested providing external feedback to facilitate better student SRL. However, SRL involves many meta-cognitive internal processes that are hidden and difficult to observe and measure. This study proposed a SRL model to illustrate the relationship among external SRL tools, internal SRL processes, internal feedback, and external feedback. Based on the model, this study designed a system with SRL tools and open leaner models (OLMs) to assist students in conducting SRL, including self-assessing their initial learning performance (i.e. perceived initial performance and monitoring of learning performance) after listening to a teacher's lecture, being assessed by and receiving external feedback from the OLM (i.e. actual performance) in the system, setting target goals (i.e. desired performance) of follow-up learning, conducting follow-up learning (i.e. strategy implementation), and evaluating their follow-up learning performance (i.e. perceived outcome performance and strategy outcome monitoring). These SRL tools also externalize students' internal SRL processes and feedback, including perceived initial, desired, and perceived outcome performances, for investigation. In addition, this study explores the impact of external feedback from the OLM on students' internal SRL processes and feedback. An evaluation was conducted to record and analyze students' SRL processes and performance, and a questionnaire was administered to ask students about their SRL processes. There are three main findings. First, the results showed that students often have poor internal SRL processes and poor internal feedback, including poor self-assessment, inappropriate target goals, a failure to conduct follow-up learning, and a failure to achieve their goals. Second, the results revealed that the SRL tools and external feedback from the OLM assisted most students in SRL, including monitoring their learning performance, goal-setting, strategy implementation and monitoring, and strategy outcome monitoring.

The paper reports two converging and complimentary approaches, namely case studies and experimentation. First, case studies are used to explore the extent to which effective e-learning systems comply with eight specific factors. Of the eight, accessibility, individual differences and student modeling turn out to be the weakest points in current practice. Second, an empirical study investigates the influences of user individual user differences on users' learning outcomes in an e-learning environment. The experiment found that individual differences in motivation to learn and expectations about e-learning significantly impacted users' learning achievements. Third, based on these studies, improvements in research methodology are identified towards greater consideration of user sensitive research issues, thus enabling us to outline improved experimental procedures.

Based upon the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, the ability to use language is viewed as one of several cognitive competences that are mobilised and modified when individuals communicate. To combine the different types of learning underlying the European Framework, a student model has been developed for COPPER that represents linguistic competences in a detailed way, combining high granularity expert-centric Bayesian networks with multidimensional stereotypes, and is updated following student activities semi-automatically. Instances of this model are used by an adaptive group formation algorithm that dynamically generates communicative groups based upon the linguistic capabilities of available students, and a collection of collaborative activity templates. As well as the student model, which is a representation of individual linguistic knowledge, preferences, etc., there is a group model, which is a representation of how a set of students works together. The results of a student's activity within a group are evaluated by a student monitor, with more advanced linguistic competences, thereby sidestepping the difficulties present when using NLP techniques to automatically analyse non-restricted linguistic production. The monitor role empowers students and further consolidates what has been previously learnt. Students therefore initially work individually in this framework on certain linguistic concepts, and subsequently participate in authentic collaborative communicative activities, where their linguistic competences can develop approximately as they would in 'real foreign language immersion experiences'.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,16,,,0924-1868,1573-1391,,,,,,,"Univ Natl Educ Distancia, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Informat, Dpto Lenguajes & Sistemas Informat, Madrid 28040, SpainUniv Natl Educ Distancia, Dpto Fac Filologia Extranjeras & Sus Linguist, Madrid 28040, SpainUniv Antonio Nebrija, Dpto Ingn Informat, Madrid, Spain",,,,2006-09-01,WOS:000240914200007,

EFDLS consists of a central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components: a feature-based student-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. For each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its teacher's hidden layers to its student's hidden layers via knowledge distillation, where the teacher and student have identical network structures. For each connected user, its student model's hidden layers' weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the server, with the least square distance (LSD) used to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected user such that the user's and its partner's weights are the closest among all the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user's and its partner's weights to these two users which then load the received weights to their teachers' hidden layers. Experimental results show that compared with a number of state-of-the-art federated learning (FL) algorithms, our proposed EFDLS wins 20 out of 44 standard UCR2018 datasets and achieves the highest mean accuracy (70.14%) on these datasets.

In this study, we present a different approach, employing artificial languages, and artificial learners. We built a set of five artificial languages whose underlying grammars and vocabulary were manipulated to ensure a known degree of similarity between each pair of languages.We next built a series of neural networkmodels for each language, and sequentially trained them on pairs of languages. These models thus represented L1 speakers learning L2s. By observing the change in activity of the cells between the L1-speaker model and the L2-learner model, we estimated how much change was needed for the model to learn the new language. We then compared the change for each L1/L2 bilingual model to the underlying similarity across each language pair. The results showed that this approach can not only recover the facilitative effect of similarity on L2 acquisition, but can also offer new insights into the differential effects across different domains of similarity.

The formative evaluation focused on the comparison of the system's performance to the performance of human experts concerning the diagnosis accuracy. The system was also evaluated for its behaviour when using two different historical texts. Empirical evaluation conducted with human experts and real students indicated the need for revision of the diagnosis model.

We explore this detector's generalizability, and find that it transfers successfully to both new students and new tutor lessons.",,,,,,,,,87,0,1,0,0,0,88,,,0924-1868,1573-1391,,,,,,,"Carnegie Mellon Univ, Human Comp Interact Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USACarnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh Sci Learning Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USACarnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",,,,2008-08-01,WOS:000256622800002,

Learning styles and cognitive traits have been the subjects of research in this area. Although learning institutions use Learning Management Systems such as Moodle, Claroline, and Blackboard to facilitate teaching, the platforms do not have features for analyzing data and identifying behavior such as learning styles and cognitive traits. Instead, they only produce certain statistical reports from the daily access records. Even though complex models have been proposed in the literature, most studies are based on a single behavior such as learning styles or cognitive traits but not both. Only a few have investigated a combination of cognition-based theories such as working memory capacity and psychology-based ones such as learning styles. Thus, this study sought to answer the research question of whether it was possible to establish a methodology for the estimation of learning styles and cognitive traits from a learning management system. The study combined the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model and Cognitive Trait Model as theoretical frameworks to identify behavior in a Learning Management System. This study designed a model for extracting records from Learning Management Systems access records to estimate learning style and cognitive traits. From this, a prototype was developed to estimate the learning style and cognitive traits for each student. The model was evaluated by administering manual tools to students in a classroom environment then comparing the results gathered against those estimated by the model. The results analyzed using Kappa statistics demonstrated the interrater reliability results were moderately in agreement. Taken together, these results suggest that it is possible to estimate the learning styles and cognitive traits of a learner in a Learning Management System. The information generated by the model can be used by tutors to provide a conducive online learning environment where learners with similar behavior ask each other for help. This can reduce the teaching load for online tutors because learners themselves act as a teaching resource. Information on learning styles and cognitive styles can also facilitate online group formation by isolating the individual factors that contribute to team success.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,,2405-8440,,,,,,,"Univ Nairobi, Sch Comp & Informat, Box 30197, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",,,,2021-09-18,WOS:000691788700024,34401582

The primary finding is that air pollution has a positive impact on a country's FDI outflows. It is also found that air pollution is a more important and robust factor affecting outward investment than the effective corporate tax rate, political risk and the level of economic development.

Therefore, this paper focuses on MPT on real roads using a moving camera. Although convolutional neural network (CNN)-based single object tracking methods have recently been proposed, the online learning of CNN for MPT is a significant burden in terms of real-time processing. However, because the features extracted from CNN are a good representation and achieve a high generalization capability, to reduce the learning time, a shallow pre-trained CNN was applied in the present study as a feature extractor instead of an object tracker As an online tracker, this study uses random ferns (RF) with pre-trained CNN output feature, which can make the problem computationally tractable and robustness. However, a large RF requires significant amount of memory and computational complexity, and is still a burden in terms of online learning in cases of multi-pedestrian tracking. Therefore, we introduce a teacher-student model compression algorithm for selecting a few optimal ferns for each tracker, thereby, reducing the online learning time. The online learning of a student-RF tracker has an advantage in that it can adaptively update the tracker to achieve robustness against various changes, such as in pose and illumination, and partial occlusions within a limited period of time. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to benchmark video sequences captured from a moving camera that include multiple pedestrians in various poses. Specifically, the proposed algorithm yields a more accurate tracking performance than the other state-of-the-art methods.",,,,,,,,,15,1,0,0,0,0,16,,,2169-3536,,,,,,,,"Keimyung Univ, Dept Comp Engn, ZA-1095 Daegu, South Africa",Keimyung Univ,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000445465000001,

However, building Adaptive Educational systems that adapt to different learning characteristics is not easy. Major research questions exist such as: how are the relevant learning characteristics identified, how does modelling of the learner take place and in what way should the learning environment change for users with different learning characteristics?EDUCE is one system that addresses these challenges by using Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences (MI) as the basis for dynamically modelling learning characteristics and for designing instructional material. This paper describes a research study, using EDUCE, that explores the effect of using different adaptive presentation strategies and the impact on learning performance when material is matched and mismatched with learning preferences. The results suggest that students with low levels of learning activity, and, who use only a limited number of the resources available, have the most to benefit from adaptive presentation strategies and that surprisingly learning gain increases when they are provided with resources not normally preferred.

It is necessary to find an effective trade-off between high utility and strong privacy. In this work, we propose a discriminative-generative distillation approach to learn privacy-preserving deep models. Our key idea is taking models as bridge to distill knowledge from private data and then transfer it to learn a student network via two streams. First, discriminative stream trains a baseline classifier on private data and an ensemble of teachers on multiple disjoint private subsets, respectively. Then, generative stream takes the classifier as a fixed discriminator and trains a generator in a data-free manner. After that, the generator is used to generate massive synthetic data which are further applied to train a variational autoencoder (VAE). Among these synthetic data, a few of them are fed into the teacher ensemble to query labels via differentially private aggregation, while most of them are embedded to the trained VAE for reconstructing synthetic data. Finally, a semi-supervised student learning is performed to simultaneously handle two tasks: knowledge transfer from the teachers with distillation on few privately labeled synthetic data, and knowledge enhancement with tangent-normal adversarial regularization on many triples of reconstructed synthetic data. In this way, our approach can control query cost over private data and mitigate accuracy degradation in a unified manner, leading to a privacy-preserving student model.

However, conventional systems are typically built on the assumption that all modalities exist, and the lack of modalities always leads to poor inference performance. Furthermore, extracting pretrained embeddings for all modalities is computationally inefficient for inference. In this work, to achieve high efficiency-performance multimodal transfer learning, we propose VideoAdviser, a video knowledge distillation method to transfer multimodal knowledge of video-enhanced prompts from a multimodal fundamental model (teacher) to a specific modal fundamental model (student). With an intuition that the best learning performance comes with professional advisers and smart students, we use a CLIP-based teacher model to provide expressive multimodal knowledge supervision signals to a RoBERTa-based student model via optimizing a step-distillation objective loss-first step: the teacher distills multimodal knowledge of video-enhanced prompts from classification logits to a regression logit-second step: the multimodal knowledge is distilled from the regression logit of the teacher to the student. We evaluate our method in two challenging multimodal tasks: video-level sentiment analysis (MOSI and MOSEI datasets) and audio-visual retrieval (VEGAS dataset). The student (requiring only the text modality as input) achieves an MAE score improvement of up to 12.3% for MOSI and MOSEI. Our method further enhances the state-of-the-art method by 3.4% mAP score for VEGAS without additional computations for inference.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adaptive multi-teacher multi-level knowledge distillation learning framework (AMTML-KD), which consists two novel insights: (i) associating each teacher with a latent representation to adaptively learn instance-level teacher importance weights which are leveraged for acquiring integrated soft-targets (high-level knowledge) and (ii) enabling the intermediate-level hints (intermediate-level knowledge) to be gathered from multiple teachers by the proposed multi-group hint strategy. As such, a student model can learn multi-level knowledge from multiple teachers through AMTML-KD.

A knowledge-associated embedding (KAE) module is proposed to capture the distinctiveness of multiskills via the process of knowledge propagation and knowledge aggregation based on predefined knowledge-paths. Then, to simulate the memory recall phenomenon of the learners in KT, we design a memory-aware module for long short-term memory (MA-LSTM) networks. A temporal attention layer in MA-LSTM is proposed to learn the forgetting mechanism of the human brain. Finally, we introduce a learning-gain (LG) layer to obtain learners' benefits after each exercise. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets illustrate that our KMKT model performs better than the other baseline models, which verifies the effectiveness of our work.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2329-924X,,,,,,,,"South China Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R ChinaSouth China Normal Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Foshan 528225, Peoples R China",,,,2023-09-23,WOS:001064593900001,

This study was performed to evaluate a new training model that emphasizes the repetition of simple procedures. METHODS: Laparoscopic surgery was performed in rabbits (n = 200) using conventional instruments. Gynaecologists (n = 10) and medical students (n = 10) performed a series of exercises during 20 full days training. Nephrectomy was chosen to evaluate and score laparoscopic skills, i.e. duration of surgery and complication rate, since it mimics the surgical challenge and involves dissection of major vessels. Each surgeon performed 20 nephrectomies, alternating left and right sides. RESULTS: Duration of surgery and complications decreased with training. For duration of surgery, a two-phase exponential decay learning curve, with different decays for gynaecologists and students, was observed. Gynaecologists achieved shorter operating times than students for real and calculated times in the first procedure (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001) and for calculated time in the last procedure (P = 0.001). Severe complications were more frequent in students than in gynaecologists (P = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: The rabbit nephrectomy model is suitable for training in laparoscopic surgery. Since it implies the repetition of short and well-defined exercises, progression is easier to monitor and the necessity for continuous supervision is less, making training less expensive.",,,,,,,,,24,1,0,0,3,2,26,,,0268-1161,,,,,,,,"Katholieke Univ Leuven, Univ Hosp Gasthuisberg, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, B-3000 Louvain, BelgiumKatholieke Univ Leuven, Univ Hosp Gasthuisberg, Ctr Surg Technol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000187827100033,14688180

In this study, we compared the effectiveness of these three linguistic theories for modeling EFL learners' personalized vocabulary learning via task recommendations.

Recently, these environments have evolved into more advanced ones using 3D technologies and taking into account the individual learner needs and preferences. This focus has led a shift to more personalized learning approaches, requiring that the environments adapt themselves to the learner. Then, many adaptive 3D environments have explored adaptive features to create new and enhanced learning experiences in different contexts. However, very little is known about both what factors are involved with adaptive 3D environments to achieve learning benefits and what assessment factors are present in current studies. For this reason, this review analyzes the recent publications on Adaptive 3D Virtual Learning Environments. Findings have revealed that these environments have covered factors on defining the learner's model, the instructional strategies and contents, and the adaptations mechanisms. Nearly half of the environments have addressed thorough assessments whereas the rest has not reported any evaluation at all. Moreover, when they report assessment, promising outcomes have also been shown not only in multiple domains of knowledge but also at various stages of education.

Investigating previous studies, it is found that the mining and integration of learning-related factors can effectively improve the performance of DLKT models. This paper focuses on providing a model embedding interface for DLKT by considering multiple types of learning-related factors. We first explore and analyze four types of learning-related factors: exercise and skill, the attributes of exercise, learners' historical performance, and learners' forgetting behavior in the learning process. We then propose an Extensible Representation Learning (ERL) approach for DLKT to extract and integrate the representations of these four types of factors by setting five components: base embedding, auxiliary embedding, performance embedding, forgetting embedding, and embedding integration.

Personalized VLEs are those VLEs that provide a set of personalization functionalities, such as personalizing learning plans, learning materials, tests, and are capable of initializing the interaction with learners by providing advice, necessary instant messages, etc., to online learners. One of the major challenges involved in developing personalized VLEs is to achieve effective personalization functionalities, such as personalized content management, learner model, learner plan and adaptive instant interaction. Autonomous intelligent agents provide an important technology for accomplishing personalization in VLEs. A number of agents work collaboratively to enable personalization by recognizing an individual's eLeaming pace and reacting correspondingly.In this research, a personalization model has been developed that demonstrates dynamic eLearning processes; secondly, this study proposes an architecture for PVLE by using intelligent decision-making agents' autonomous, pre-active and proactive behaviors. A prototype system has been developed to demonstrate the implementation of this architecture. Furthemore, a field experiment has been conducted to investigate the performance of the prototype by comparing PVLE eLearning effectiveness with a non-personalized VLE. Data regarding participants' final exam scores were collected and analyzed. The results indicate that intelligent agent technology can be employed to achieve personalization in VLEs, and as a consequence to improve eLeaming effectiveness dramatically. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, results obtained through traditional research methods have issues in terms of accuracy and precision which need to be addressed. In general, the existing automatic detection approaches are only able to provide satisfactory results for specific learning style models and/or dimensions, or even only work for certain learning management systems. The aim of this study is to propose an automatic detection of learning styles from the analysis of students' learning behaviour by constructing a mathematical model. This study specifically explores the relationship between students' learning behaviour and their learning styles. To investigate this relationship, a pilot experiment was conducted with 33 students. The students used Moodle platform, a learning management system, as supplementary online learning material for Java programing. The students' learning behaviour was tracked and recorded. Thirty students' data (i.e. their learning behaviour and learning styles; measured using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) instrument) were analysed using the proposed correlation analysis to identify the relationship. The remaining three students' learning behaviour data were used to predict their learning styles. The findings are discussed with regard to accuracy of automatic detection of learning styles using the ILS instrument.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,0011-3891,,,,,,,,"Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Artificial Intelligence, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417747200021,

Being aware of it helps the student to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and the teacher to provide more valuable personalized interventions. Furthermore, learning style-based adaptive educational systems can be designed, which have been shown to increase student satisfaction or learning gain, while reducing the time needed to learn. It is therefore important to have an accurate method for identifying students' learning styles. Since the traditional approach of filling in dedicated psychological questionnaires has several disadvantages, automatic methods have been proposed, based on investigating student observable behavior in a learning environment. Research done so far generally takes a mono-algorithmic approach to identify learning styles, and the precision rates leave room for improvement. Hence, in this paper we propose a novel hybrid multi-step architecture based on ant colony system and artificial neural networks to increase the precision of learning styles identification. Two different variants are proposed and evaluated with data from 75 students; results show high precision values, outperforming existing automatic approaches for learning style identification. The proposed architecture can be integrated into widely used educational systems (e.g., learning management systems) to provide learners and/or teachers with information about students' learning styles. In addition, it can be integrated into adaptive educational systems and plugins of learning management systems to automatically identify learning styles and personalize instruction respectively.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The findings reveal that in the teaching processes that were designed based on CT practices, the total scores of the students' model-based explanations were significantly higher compared to the traditional approach.

One of the main components is an animated pedagogical agent who guides trainees and provides instruction. The agent deploys different facial expressions conveying emotion and empathy to trainees. We incorporated these constructs into the learning model aiming to achieve credibility, social interaction, and user engagement, and thus improve learning. To develop the agent, we included some of the basic characteristics of electricians: work uniform and safety gear, such as helmets, gloves, and glasses, among other features. We believe that by representing the tutor as an electrician, the training environment will be better accepted by operators. The focus of this paper is a study that we conducted to gather knowledge about the expressivity and appearance of the animated agent.

Could we use behavior patterns to build a data-driven model of individual differences that could be more useful for predicting critical outcomes of the learning process than traditional models? Our paper attempts to answer these questions using a large volume of learner data collected in an online practice system. We apply a sequential pattern mining approach to build individual models of learner practice behavior and reveal latent student subgroups that exhibit considerably different practice behavior. Using these models we explored the connections between learner behavior and both, the incoming and outgoing parameters of the learning process. Among incoming parameters we examined traditionally collected individual differences such as self-esteem, gender, and knowledge monitoring skills. We also attempted to bridge the gap between cluster-based behavior pattern models and traditional scale-based models of individual differences by quantifying learner behavior on a latent data-driven scale.

A post-hoc analysis was conducted on the top 10 participant's models by comparing the evaluation of their performance on synthetic and private validation datasets. Several models trained on synthetic data were found to perform significantly poorer when applied to the non-synthetic private dataset.

Our CUSP (Course and Unit of Study Portal) system tackles this challenge, by helping subject teachers define the curriculum of their subject, linking it to Faculty and institutional goals. The same information is available to students, enabling them to see how each subject relates to those goals. It then gives additional big-picture views of the degree for the academics responsible for the whole degree, including the ability to easily assess if a degree meets accreditation requirements. CUSP achieves this by exploiting a lightweight semantic mapping approach that gives a highly flexible and scalable way to map learning goals from multiple internal and external accrediting sources across the degree. We report its validation as used in a live university environment, across three diverse faculties, with 277 degrees and 7,810 subject sessions over a period of three years. Data from this evaluation indicates steady improvement in the documentation of the relationships between subjects, assessments, learning outcomes, and program level goals. This is driven by the reporting tools and visualizations provided by CUSP, which enable program designers and lecturers to identify parts of the curriculum that are unclear. This improved documentation of the curriculum enables more accurate and immediate quality reviews.

On the one hand, by constructing a learner model and a MOOC resource ontology model, based on the learner's characteristics, the learner's MOOC resource learning preference is predicted, and a recommendation list is formed. On the other hand, the semantic association algorithm is used to calculate the correlation between the MOOC resources to be recommended and the learners' rated resources and predict the learner's learning preferences to form a recommendation list. Finally, the two recommendation lists were comprehensively analyzed to form the final MOOC resource personalized recommendation list. Findings The semantic association algorithm based on hierarchical correlation analysis and attribute correlation analysis introduced in this study can effectively analyze the semantic similarity between MOOC resources. The hybrid recommendation method that introduces ontology construction technology and performs semantic association analysis can effectively realize the personalized recommendation of MOOC resources.

However, to date little work exists on either of these aspects. Here, we focus on the modeling step. Specifically, we explore the utility of various sensing devices, including an eye tracker, a skin conductance bracelet, and an EEG sensor, for modeling creativity during an educational activity, namely geometry proof generation.

A number of Web-based systems have been developed and students are more and more used to access to this type of systems. The rapid development of mobile handheld devices and wireless technologies has given rise to a widespread use of different devices such as PDAs, mobile phones, laptops or tablet PCs, among others. These devices, along with those technologies, constitute a new and attracting opportunity for learning through the Internet. This has motivated the creation of platforms and systems to support mobile learning.Different needs, interests, preferences, cognitive abilities or learning styles can determine the way each student accesses to available learning resources, processes information, solves practical work, relates to his/her mates and teachers, and, definitely, takes advantage of the learning process. These features are part of what is called the student model and should be considered in both individual and collaborative e-learning environments.With the aim of guiding students during the learning process, adaptation techniques have been used to personalize and adapt the activities proposed to each of them at each time, the navigational possibilities and the learning resources offered (multimedia materials, collaboration tools, etc). Moreover, one learning situation can be completely different from another, and the suitability of learning activities for students in specific contexts may vary depending not only on the student features or previous actions but also on their particular situation. This suggests the convenience of modeling the student context and using adaptation techniques so that, given a student accessing to a system in a particular context, the system is able to recommend her the most suitable activities to be accomplished in that specific situation.Adaptive individual and collaborative e-learning and m-learning environments are described. More specifically, the basis of three adaptive e-learning systems will be explained in detail: TANGOW, an adaptive web-based system that guides each student during the learning process by personalizing and adapting the activities and resources to the user's needs, characteristics and previous actions; COL-TANGOW, an extension of TANGOW to support collaboration, able to form workgroups dynamically and also to generate adapted collaborative workspaces at runtime to support the realization of collaborative activities by different groups of students; and CoMoLE, a system able to take into account the student context at a certain time to recommend her the most suitable learning activities to be accomplished at that time in that specific context.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-60456-680-2,,,,,,"Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000273429800011,

Understanding the prior knowledge of learners plays a key role in providing personalized learning, which many studies suggest is a successful learning paradigm for vocabulary acquisition, one that aims to optimize instructional approaches and paces by catering to individual learning needs. A powerful learner profile model which can represent learner's prior knowledge is therefore important for word learning systems to better facilitate personalized learning. In this article, we investigated various methods to establish learner profiles and attempted to determine the optimal method.

While much work has been done to provide adaptive assistance when students seek help, they may not seek help optimally. This had led to the growing interest in proactive adaptive assistance, where the tutor provides unsolicited assistance upon predictions of struggle or unproductivity. Determining when and whether to provide personalized support is a well-known challenge called the assistance dilemma. Addressing this dilemma is particularly challenging in openended domains, where there can be several ways to solve problems. Researchers have explored methods to determine when to proactively help students, but few of these methods have taken prior hint usage into account. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach to incorporate students' hint usage in predicting their need for help. We explore its impact in an intelligent tutor that deals with the open-ended and well-structured domain of logic proofs. We present a controlled study to investigate the impact of an adaptive hint policy based on predictions of HelpNeed that incorporate students' hint usage. We showempirical evidence to support that such a policy can save students a significant amount of time in training and lead to improved posttest results, when compared to a control without proactive interventions. We also show that incorporating students' hint usage significantly improves the adaptive hint policy's efficacy in predicting students' HelpNeed, thereby reducing training unproductivity, reducing possible help avoidance, and increasing possible help appropriateness (a higher chance of receiving help when it was likely to be needed).

In this paper, we propose a novel Two-Stage Representation method (TSR), and convert it to a Single-Teacher Single-Student (STSS) problem in our two-stage knowledge transfer framework for image classification. Specifically, the first stage classifier is formulated as the teacher, which holds the 'gate value' to supervise the student classifier in the second stage. To transfer knowledge from the teacher classifier, we seek the nearest neighbours of the test sample to generate a set of candidate target classes in the first stage. Then, a student classifier learns from the samples belonging to these candidate classes in the second stage. Under the supervision of the teacher classifier, the teacher approves the student only if it obtains a higher score than the 'gate value'. In actuality, the proposed framework generates a stronger classifier by staging two weaker classifiers in a novel way. The experiments on several databases show that our proposed framework is effective, which outperforms multiple popular classification methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the large gap between the teacher and the student in terms of capacity is not conducive to KD. Consequently, a large teacher network is not necessarily the most suitable teacher to guide the student. Therefore, this study proposes a multiple homogeneous teacher-guided KD method. First, multiple networks with the same structure as that of the student are pretrained to act as a teacher group, which is different from utilizing a large teacher network in traditional KD, to alleviate the capacity gap between the teacher and student. Second, a confidence-adaptive initialization strategy is developed to initialize the student network, which learns knowledge from the pretrained teacher group. Experiments are performed on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet using three networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed KD method outperforms existing advanced KD methods. Furthermore, a similarity loss function is introduced to optimize the parameters of the classifier in the student network. The experimental results indicate that this loss function improves the performance for basic classification tasks without KD and efficiently works in the proposed KD method. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, we explore an adapt-and-explain scaffolding strategy in which a robot acts as a peer-like tutor who dynamically adapts its behavior or the learning tasks to the cognitive and affective state of the child, and provides verbal explanations of these adaptations. An evaluation study with 40 children shows that children benefit from the learning adaptation and that the explanations have a positive effect especially for slower learners. Further, in 76% of all cases the robot managed to re-engage children who started to disengage from the learning interaction, helping them to achieve an overall higher learning gain.

It uses concept map model to regulate the topic hierarchy, to measure the student's knowledge about a topic and to stimulate learning. By employing a concept map model, it structures the course and provides an environment in which the lecturer can arrange the chapters, topics, concepts and the prerequisite relationships between the concepts. Thus, it offers an adaptive and effective learning environment by measuring the level of student's knowledge about a topic, offering reinforcing feedback, diagnosing students' weaknesses and directing them to related chapter topic in the domain for revisions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach an experiment has been conducted on Computer Programming department in Object Oriented Programming course.

On the other hand, long-term motivation indicates a sort of continuing commitment that is required to complete assigned task. As short-term motivational problems span for a limited period of time, such as a session, therefore, they need to be addressed in real time to keep the learner engaged in the learning process. Similarly, long-term learners' motivation plays an equally important role to retain the learner in the long run and minimize the risk of dropout. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to incorporate a comprehensive learner motivation model that is based on short-term and long-term aspects of the learners' motivation. This approach enables Web-based educational systems to identify the real-time motivational state of the learner and provide personalized interventions to keep the learners engaged in learning process. Design/methodology/approach Recent research regarding personalized Web-based educational systems demonstrates learner's motivation to be an essential component of the learning model. This is because of the fact that low motivation results in either students' less engagement or complete drop out from the learning activities. A learner motivation model is considered to be a set of perceptions and beliefs that the system has developed about a learner. This includes both short-term and long-term motivations of leaners. Findings This study proposed a framework of a domain independent learners' motivation model based on firm educational theories. The proposed framework consists of two modules. The primary module deals with real-time identification of motivation and logging off activities such as login, forum participation and adherence to assessment deadline. Secondary module maintains the profile of leaners associated with both short-term and long-term motivation. A study was conducted to verify the impact of learners' motivation model and personalized interventional strategies based on proposed model, using Systematical Information Education Method assessment standards. The results show an increase in motivational index and the characteristics associated with motivation during the conducted study. Originality/value Motivational diagnosis is important for both traditional classrooms and Web-based education systems. It is one of the major elements that contribute in the success of the learning process. However, dropout rate among online students is very high, which leads to incorporate motivational elements in more personalized way because motivated students will retain the course until they successfully complete it. Hence, identifying learner's motivation, updating learners' motivation model based on this identification and providing personalized interventions are the key for the success of Web-based educational systems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1741-5659,1758-8510,,,,,,,"COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Comp Sci, Attock Campus, Attock, Punjab, PakistanAmer Realty Acad, Phoenix, AZ USA",Amer Realty Acad,,,2021-12-04,WOS:000724030100003,

Results showed that students' overall success rates of model building were approaching 50%; the duration of participants' modeling time decreased with the increase of the experimental labs; the benefits of doing physics labs with smartphones were confirmed by the success rates, personal preferences, and students' feedback. Regarding students' spontaneous model building behavior in the first lab, almost 90% of the participants fitted data with linear equation; most participants adjusted coefficients to fit the data, instead of changing the highest degree of equation; and different strategies were used by successful participants and the others.

Constructing and using models are core scientific practices that have gained significant attention within K-12 and higher education. Although modeling is a broadly applicable process, within physics education, it has been preferentially applied to the iterative development of broadly applicable principles (e.g., Newton's laws of motion in introductory mechanics). A significant feature of the new framework is that measurement tools (in addition to the physical system being studied) are subjected to the process of modeling. Think-aloud interviews were used to refine the framework and demonstrate its utility by documenting examples of model-based reasoning in the laboratory. When applied to the think-aloud interviews, the framework captures and differentiates students' model-based reasoning and helps identify areas of future research. The interviews showed how students productively applied similar facets of modeling to the physical system and measurement tools: construction, prediction, interpretation of data, identification of model limitations, and revision. Finally, we document students' challenges in explicitly articulating assumptions when constructing models of experimental systems and further challenges in model construction due to students' insufficient prior conceptual understanding.

This article investigates an inductive approach to automatically constructing models of self-efficacy that can be used at runtime to inform pedagogical decisions. It reports on two complementary empirical studies. In the first study, two families of self-efficacy models were induced: a static self-efficacy model, learned solely from pre-test (non-intrusively collected) data, and a dynamic self-efficacy model, learned from both pre-test data as well as runtime physiological data collected with a biofeedback apparatus. In the second empirical study, a similar experimental design was applied to an interactive narrative-centered learning environment. Self-efficacy models were induced from combinations of static and dynamic information, including pre-test data, physiological data, and observations of student behavior in the learning environment. The highest performing induced naive Bayes models correctly classified 85.2% of instances in the first empirical study and 82.1% of instances in the second empirical study. The highest performing decision tree models correctly classified 86.9% of instances in the first study and 87.3% of instances in the second study.",,,,,,,,,83,0,0,0,1,0,83,,,0924-1868,1573-1391,,,,,,,"N Carolina State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USAEmergent Game Technologies, Chapel Hill, NC USA",Emergent Game Technologies,,,2008-02-01,WOS:000252678000004,

Because cognitive diagnosis models play a very important role in predicting learner performance and recommending personalized learning resources such as exercises, course videos, and course audio, they have received great attention from researchers. However, existing cognitive diagnosis models mostly start from the interactive perspective of learners' answers, ignoring the internal quantitative relationship between exercises and knowledge concepts. This study proposes a novel quantitative relationship-based explainable cognitive diagnosis model called QRCDM. First, learners' concept proficiency was defined based on their answers to objective and subjective questions. Correlation hypotheses are then proposed, which include the explicit correlation between exercises and their corresponding knowledge concepts, as well as the implicit correlation between exercises and the non-inclusive concept. Finally, two contribution matrices of exercises and knowledge concepts through a neural network designed in this study are calculated based on the above hypotheses, which can predict the learner's concept proficiency and answer score. To reduce the noisy data, the learners' faults and guessing factors were also considered. In the experiments, the proposed QRCDM was compared with two classical models, DINA, FuzzyCDF and three latest state-of-the-art models, DeepCDM, NeuralCDM and RCD on five real datasets, and the most experimental results on the majority metrics show the effectiveness and interpretability of this work.

The existing mainstream KT models, only attribute learners' feedback to the degree of knowledge mastery and leave the influence of mental ability factors out of consideration. Although ability is an essential component of the problem-solving process, these knowledge-centered models cause a contradiction between data fitting and rationalization of the model decision-making process, making it difficult to achieve high precision and readability simultaneously.In this paper, an innovative KT model, ability boosted knowledge tracing (ABKT)(1) is pro-posed, which introduces the ability factor into learning feedback attribution to enable the model to analyze the learning process from two perspectives, knowledge and ability, simul-taneously. Based on constructive learning theory, continuous matrix factorization (CMF) model is proposed to simulate the knowledge internalization process, following the initiative growth and stationarity principles. In addition, the linear graph latent ability (LGLA) model is proposed to construct learner and item latent ability features, from graph-structured learner interaction data. Then, the knowledge and ability dual-tracing framework is constructed to integrate the knowledge and ability modules.

However, recent studies conducted in Indian metros have expressed concern about students' mathematics learning. Except in some private coaching academies, regular classroom teaching does not include problem solving in mathematics, but is limited to mere practice exercises and drills of known exercises. For describing mathematical thinking, Schoenfeld gave a framework containing four components: resources, heuristics, controls and beliefs. Beginning in childhood we develop an ontology for the ideas we learn, and this ontology evolves as we continue learning. Ontologies used for teaching need to incorporate elements of mathematical thinking popularized by problem solving experts. So teaching that makes use of such ontologies of problems, problem solving strategies, and tasks would be beneficial to students. In this paper we identify the gaps in the literature on teaching problem solving, and discuss how and why ontologies can be used for teaching problem solving in mathematics at the high school level. As a proof of concept, we describe the method by which an ontology named MONTO has been created for teaching problem solving in mathematics, and give examples of its use.

By making and executing models of dynamic systems in a computer environment, students are stimulated to learn about the specific domain that is modeled as well as about the process of modeling in general. However, learning by modeling also leads to characteristic student mistakes, based on a combination of faulty domain knowledge and insufficient modeling skills. In this article, we describe a method of generating advice to students during their modeling process. The on-line advice system was informed by our observations of a teacher who gave advice via a textual communication tool to students building models with a System Dynamics model editor. The first version of the on-line advice system was evaluated in two ways: first, three teachers evaluated the advice the system generated for students' final solutions; second, we analyzed the advice the system provided as it was used by a sample of students who were building a physics model. These evaluations showed that the overall approach, including matching a student solution to a family of reference solutions together with the other mechanisms of the advice system, is valid. However, they also highlighted the difficulty of building 'intelligent' support to help students to improve their models and gain modeling expertise. The article concludes with a discussion of our current efforts to improve the advice system based on the lessons learnt, which suggest extension of the range of solution representations and of the operations of the advice method.

This approach is fully implemented and evaluated in an educational application module, called fuzzy knowledge state definer (FuzKSD). In particular, FuzKSD performs user modeling by dynamically identifying and updating a student's knowledge level of all the concepts of the domain knowledge. The operation of FuzKSD is based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) that are used to represent the dependences among the domain concepts. FuzKSD uses fuzzy sets to represent a student's knowledge level as a subset of the domain knowledge. Thus, it combines fuzzy theory with the overlay model. Moreover, it employs a novel inference mechanism that dynamically updates user stereotypes using fuzzy sets. It should be noted that the overlay model and stereotypes constitute two widely used methods for user modeling. However, they have not been combined with fuzzy sets thus far in the literature. The gain from this novel combination is significant as a student level of knowledge is represented in a more realistic way by automatically modeling the learning or forgetting process of a student with respect to the FCMs and thus the system can provide individualized adaptive advice. The application of this approach is not limited to adaptive instruction. It can also be used in other systems with changeable user states, such as e-shops, where consumers' preferences change over time and affect one another. Therefore, the particular module constitutes a novel generic fuzzy tool, which offers dynamic adaptation to users' needs and preferences of adaptive systems.",,,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,0,0,43,,,1063-6706,1941-0034,,,,,,,"Univ Piraeus, Dept Informat, Piraeus 18534, Greece",,,,2015-03-11,WOS:000349418100014,

It is often a challenge to determine exactly what type of domain dependent data will be stored and how it will be evaluated by a user modeling system. The most important disadvantage of these models is that they classify the knowledge of users without taking into account the weight differences among the domain dependent data of users. For this purpose, both the probabilistic and the instance-based models have been developed and commonly used in the user modeling systems. In this study a powerful, efficient and simple 'Intuitive Knowledge Classifier' method is proposed and presented to model the domain dependent data of users. A domain independent object model, the user modeling approach and the weight-tuning method are combined with instance-based classification algorithm to improve classification performances of well-known the Bayes and the k-nearest neighbor-based methods. The proposed knowledge classifier intuitively explores the optimum weight values of students' features on their knowledge class first. Then it measures the distances among the students depending on their data and the values of weights. Finally, it uses the dissimilarities in the classification process to determine their knowledge class. The experimental studies have shown that the weighting of domain dependent data of students and combination of user modeling algorithms and population-based searching approach play an essential role in classifying performance of user modeling system. The proposed system improves the classification accuracy of instance-based user modeling approach for all distance metrics and different k-values. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Generally, the knowledge construction procedure is constantly evolving because students dynamically learn and forget over time. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge most existing approaches consider only a fragment of the information that relates to learning or forgetting, and the problem of making use of rich information during learners' learning interactions to achieve more precise prediction of learner performance in KT remains under-explored. Moreover, existing work either neglects the problem difficulty or assumes that it is constant, and this is unrealistic in the actual learning process as problem difficulty affects performance undoubtedly and also varies overtime in terms of the cognitive challenge it presents to individual learners. To this end, we herein propose a novel model, KTM-DLF (Knowledge Tracing Machine by modeling cognitive item Difficulty and Learning and Forgetting), to trace the evolution of each learner's knowledge acquisition during exercise activities by modeling his or her dynamic knowledge construction procedure and cognitive item difficulty. Specifically, we first specify the concept of cognitive item difficulty and propose a method to model the cognitive item difficulty adaptively based on learners' learning histories. Then, based on two classical theories (the learning curve theory and the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve theory), we propose a method for modeling learners' learning and forgetting over time. Finally, the KTM-DLF model is proposed to incorporate learners' abilities, the cognitive item difficulty, and the two dynamic procedures (learning and forgetting) together. We then use the factorization machine framework to embed features in high dimensions and model pairwise interactions to increase the model's accuracy.

In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners' final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners' actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners' performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners' action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R-2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively.

Among the many factors that influence the development of such skills, the literature shows that the executive functions, especially the response inhibition (RI)-that is the capability to block out or to tune out what can be considered irrelevant information or action to the learning task-is one of the most essential functions. There are specific tests used to appraise these children's inhibition skills, but these tests are generally time-consuming, and demand specialized human resources. ObjectivesWe present a computational approach to model children's RI behaviour through the analysis of educational traces left in an educational app. This modelling allows the automatic and instant identification of the RI level of children without the need of a human-conducted test. MethodsOur modelling is based on two definitions of RI found in the literature, from which we derived a mathematical formalism of three variables we used to query the traces dataset and isolate the RI behaviour of each student from the learning traces generated in the app. The sample population is composed of children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. The model is then assessed by comparing it to a traditional human-conducted RI test suitable for kindergarten children, the Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulder (HTKS) task. Results and conclusionsThe results show that our RI model can explain an important part of the HTKS variance (up to 0.45 according to the adjusted R-2) when taking the HTKS results as a dependent variable for a multiple regression model. In practice, our model can be integrated in a learning app and become a powerful tool for instant preliminary identification of dysfunctional RI behaviour, especially in the early stages of children's education. Once students are identified by our model as having a dysfunctional RI behaviour, teachers can rapidly act to help them. Besides, the proposed model requires only very simple data to work, which means it can be easily integrated into different learning apps.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0266-4909,1365-2729,,,,,,,"Univ Lorraine, Bird Team, LORIA, Nancy, FranceUniv Lorraine, 2LPN EA 7489, Nancy, FranceUniv Lorraine, Nancy, France",,,,2023-03-12,WOS:000936699500001,

The model of the student in our system is inferred using a higher level LA, referred to as a meta-LA, which attempts to characterize the learning model of the students ( or student simulators), while the latter use the tutorial-like system. The meta-LA, in turn, uses LAs as a learning mechanism to try to determine if the student in question is a fast, normal, or slow learner. The ultimate long-term goal of the exercise is the following: if the tutorial-like system can understand how the student perceives and processes knowledge, it will be able to customize the way by which it communicates the knowledge to the student to attain an optimal teaching strategy. The proposed meta-LA scheme has been tested for numerous environments, including the established benchmarks, and the results obtained are remarkable. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first published result that infers the learning model of an LA when it is externally treated as a black box, whose outputs are the only observable quantities. Additionally, our paper represents a new class of multiautomata systems, where the meta-LA synchronously communicates with the students, also modeled using LAs. The meta-LA's environment observes the progress of the student LA, and the response of the latter to the meta-LA actions is based on these observations.

The purpose of this current study is to assess the preventive, supportive and awareness-building steps taken during the COVID-19 pandemic for international students in China, that will be useful for planning such a behavioral change campaign in the potential pandemic situation in other parts of the world. Methods We conducted an online-based e-questionnaire survey among 467 international students in China through WeChat. The data collection duration was from February 20, 2020 to March 10, 2020 and we focused on their level of awareness, satisfaction, and trust in authorities regarding pandemic measures. Simple bivariate statistics was used to describe the background characteristics of the respondents along with adoption of the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) as the final model to demonstrate the relationship between the variables. Results In our study, the leading group of the respondents were within 31 to 35 years' age group (39.82%), male (61.88%), living single (58.24%) and doctoral level students (39.8%). The preventive and supportive measures taken by students and/or provided by the respective institution or authorities were positively related to students' satisfaction and had an acceptable strength (beta = 0.611, t = 9.679, p < 0.001). The trust gained in authorities also showed an acceptable strength (beta = 0.381, t = 5.653, p < 0.001) with a positive direction. Again, the personnel awareness building related to both students' satisfaction (beta = 0.295, t = 2.719, p < 0.001) and trust gain (beta = 0.131, t = 1.986, p < 0.05) in authorities had a positive and acceptable intensity. Therefore, our study clearly demonstrates the great impact of preventive and supportive measures in the development of students' satisfaction (R-2 = 0.507 indicating moderate relationship). The satisfied students possessed a strong influence which eventually helped in building sufficient trust on their institutions (R-2 = 0.797 indicating above substantial relationship). Conclusions The worldwide student group is one of the most affected and vulnerable communities in this situation. So, there is a profound ground of research on how different states or authorities handle such situation. In this study, we have depicted the types and magnitude of care taken by Chinese government and educational institutions towards international students to relieve the panic of pandemic situation.

One key reason for this is that contemporary knowledge tracing algorithms primarily infer next-problem correctness in the learning system, but do not attempt to infer the knowledge the student can carry out of the system, information more useful for teachers. The ability of knowledge tracing algorithms to predict problem correctness using data from intelligent tutoring systems has been extensively researched, but data from outcomes other than next-problem correctness have received less attention. In addition, there has been limited use of knowledge tracing algorithms in games, because algorithms that do attempt to infer knowledge from answer correctness are often too simple to capture the more complex evidence of learning within games. In this study, data from a digital learning game, (anonymized), was used to compare ten knowledge tracing algorithms' ability to predict students' knowledge carried outside the learning system-measured here by posttest scores-given their game activity. All Opportunities Averaged (AOA), a method proposed by Authors (2020) was used to convert correctness predictions to knowledge estimates, which were also compared to the built-in estimates from algorithms that produced them. Although statistical testing was not feasible for these data, three algorithms tended to perform better than the others: Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks, Logistic Knowledge Tracing, and a multivariate version of Elo. Algorithms' built-in estimates of student ability underperformed estimates produced by AOA, suggesting that some algorithms may be better at estimating performance than ability.

The first problem is that the interaction history is treated as an ordered sequence, which ignores the individual time intervals between each interaction. The second problem is that higher-order temporal features for knowledge tracing have not been extensively explored. In this paper, to address these problems, we propose a method called the Time Interval Aware Self-Attention approach for Knowledge Tracing (TISAKT), which takes the relationship between exercises into consideration. More specifically, firstly, the relationship between exercises is modeled from the interactions introduced into the absolute positions and the time intervals of answered exercises at the same time.

Then, a QR-matrix is defined to represent the relationship among questions, knowledge concepts, and responses, which describes the contexts of questions and knowledge. Furthermore, an improved LSTM model is proposed to capture the context of students' memory and forgetness, and a multi-head attention mechanism is designed to capture the context of students' behaviors.

With the support of an FSA, we discover that DKT cannot handle long sequential inputs, which leads to unstable predictions.

A wide variety of KT techniques have been developed, from Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). However, in most of these methods, the KCs are represented as stand-alone entities, and the effect of representing KCs using contexts such as learning-related factors has been under-investigated. Also, KT needs to generate personalized results to facilitate tasks such as exercise recommendation.

Specifically, the interpreting method focuses on understanding the DLKT model's predictions from the perspective of its sequential inputs. We conduct comprehensive evaluations to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed interpreting method at the skill-answer pair level. Moreover, the interpreting results also capture the skill-level semantic information, including the skill-specific difference, distance and inner relationships.

A key component of the online education system, knowledge tracing (KT) assesses the state of knowledge by tracing each learner's learning activities. The deep KT model, however, is unable to completely extract the features of the questions and skills due to the heterogeneity of the knowledge structure and the sparsity of the interaction records. The model's capacity to handle diverse data is also restricted by over parameterization. Additionally, rather than focusing solely on a precise fit, Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) should stress interpretable feedback to the learner. The deep KT approach's item parameters are still unable to give students useful feedback. This paper proposes to trace learner's short-term attentional knowledge based on heterogeneous hierarchical differentiation, named HHSKT. Hierarchical heterogeneous knowledge structures and short-term memory enhancement will be used to model the effects of different interaction sequences on learners. Specifically, knowledge structure features are extracted by constructing a heterogeneous graph-based graph information augmentation component. Question differentiation parameters are derived by transforming the TrueSkill system. Besides, learners' history-related practices are emphasized by windowing attention.

Furthermore, LFEKT introduces a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the contextual relations of learned sequences.

Furthermore, we embed the knowledge concept by using a student's abstract principle mastery level and obtain a personalized knowledge relevance matrix (a student's knowledge structure) by calculating the cosine similarity among the knowledge embedding results.

A human teacher can track the knowledge of students to customize the teaching on students' needs. With the rise of online education platforms, there is a similar need for machines to track the knowledge of students and tailor their learning experience. This is known as the Knowledge Tracing (KT) problem in the literature. Effectively solving the KT problem would unlock the potential of computer-aided education applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, curriculum learning, and learning materials' recommendation. Moreover, from a more general viewpoint, a student may represent any kind of intelligent agents including both human and artificial agents. Thus, the potential of KT can be extended to any machine teaching application scenarios which seek for customizing the learning experience for a student agent (i.e., a machine learning model). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey for the KT literature. We cover a broad range of methods starting from the early attempts to the recent state-of-the-art methods using deep learning, while highlighting the theoretical aspects of models and the characteristics of benchmark datasets.

Two main issues exist in the current DKT models: First, the complexity of the DKT models increases the tension of psychological interpretation. Second, the input of existing DKT models is only the exercise tags representing via one-hot encoding. The correlation between the hidden knowledge components and students' responses to the exercises heavily relies on training the DKT models. The existing rich and informative features are excluded in the training, which may yield sub-optimal performance. To utilize the information embedded in these features, researchers have proposed a manual method to pre-process the features, i.e., discretizing them based on the inner characteristics of individual features. However, the proposed method requires many feature engineering efforts and is infeasible when the selected features are huge. To tackle the above issues, we design an automatic system to embed the heterogeneous features implicitly and effectively into the original DKT model. More specifically, we apply tree-based classifiers to predict whether the student can correctly answer the exercise given the heterogeneous features, an effective way to capture how the student deviates from others in the exercise. The predicted response and the true response are then encoded into a 4-bit one-hot encoding and concatenated with the original one-hot encoding features on the exercise tags to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which can output the probability that a student will answer the exercise correctly on the corresponding exercise.

Contrary to existing pre-training methods that highly rely on manually labeling knowledge about the E-E, S-S, or E-S relationships, the core idea of the proposed SPAKT is to design three self-attention modules to model the E-S, E-E, and S-S relationships, respectively, and all of these three modules can be trained in the self-supervised setting.

A major task of intelligent education is Knowledge Tracing (KT) which aims to capture students' dynamic status based on their historical interaction records and predict their responses to new questions. However, most existing KT methods suffer from the record data sparsity problem. In reality, there are a huge number of questions in the online database and students can only interact with a very small set of these questions. The records of some questions could be extremely sparse, which may significantly degrade the performance of traditional KT methods. Although recent graph neural network (GNN) based KT methods can fuse graph-structured information and improve the representation of questions to some extent, the pairwise structure of GNN neglects the complex high-order and heterogeneous relations among questions. To resolve the above issues, we develop a novel KT model with the heterogeneous hypergraph network (HHN) and propose an attentive mechanism, including intra-and inter-graph attentions, to aggregate neighbors' information upon HHN. To further enhance the question representation, we supplement the supervised prediction task of KT with an auxiliary self-supervised task, i.e., we additionally generate an augmented view with adaptive data augmentation to implement contrastive learning and exploit the unobserved relations among questions.

Recent KT methods employ flexible deep neural network-based models that excel at this task. However, the adequacy of KT is still challenged by the sparseness of the learners' exercise data. To alleviate the sparseness problem, most of the exiting KT studies are performed at the skill-level rather than the question-level, as questions are often numerous and associated with much fewer skills. However, at the skill level, KT neglects the distinctive information related to the questions themselves and their relations. In this case, the models can imprecisely infer the learners' knowledge states and might fail to capture the long-term dependencies in the exercising sequences. In the knowledge domain, skills are naturally linked as a graph (with the edges being the prerequisite relations between pedagogical concepts). We refer to such a graph as a knowledge structure (KS). Incorporating a KS into the KT procedure can potentially resolve both the sparseness and information loss, but this avenue has been underexplored because obtaining the complete KS of a domain is challenging and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel KS-enhanced graph representation learning model for KT with an attention mechanism (KSGKT). We first explore eight methods that automatically infer the domain KS from learner response data and integrate it into the KT procedure. Leveraging a graph representation learning model, we then obtain the question and skill embeddings from the KS-enhanced graph. To incorporate more distinctive information on the questions, we extract the cognitive question difficulty from the learning history of each learner. We then propose a convolutional representation method that fuses these disctinctive features, thus obtaining a comprehensive representation of each question. These representations are input to the proposed KT model, and the long-term dependencies are handled by the attention mechanism. The model finally predicts the learner's performance on new problems. Extensive experiments conducted from six perspectives on three real-world data sets demonstrated the superiority and interpretability of our model for learner-performance modeling. Based on the KT results, we also suggest three potential applications of our model.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,0884-8173,1098-111X,,,,,,,"Sokendai, Natl Inst Informat, Tokyo, JapanUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China",,,,2021-12-01,WOS:000722138300001,

The models will tend to give good results in classes where there are many examples and poor results in those with few examples. This problem generally occurs when the classes to predict are imbalanced and this is frequent in educational data where for example, there are skills that are very difficult or very easy to master. There will be less data on students that correctly answered questions related to difficult skills and who incorrectly answered those related to skills easy to master. In this paper, we tackled this problem by proposing a hybrid architecture combining Deep Neural Network architectures- especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-with expert knowledge for user modeling. The proposed solution uses attention mechanism to infuse expert knowledge into the Deep Neural Network. It has been tested in two contexts: knowledge tracing in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) called Logic-Muse and prediction of socio-moral reasoning in a serious game called MorALERT. The proposed solution is compared to state-of-the-art machine learning solutions and experiments show that the resulting model can accurately predict the current student's knowledge state (in Logic-Muse) and thus enable an accurate personalization of the learning process. Other experiments show that the model can also be used to predict the level of socio-moral reasoning skills (in MorALERT). Our findings suggest the need for hybrid neural networks that integrate prior expert knowledge (especially when it is necessary to compensate for the strong dependency-of deep learning methods-on data size or the possible unbalanced datasets).

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, existing approaches can only exploit the exercising records of students, and the problem of extracting rich information existed in the materials (e.g., knowledge concepts, exercise content) of exercises to achieve both more precise prediction of student performance and more interpretable analysis of knowledge acquisition remains underexplored. To this end, in this paper, we present a holistic study of student performance prediction. To directly achieve the primary goal of performance prediction, we first propose a general Exercise-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (EERNN) framework by exploring both student's exercising records and the text content of corresponding exercises. In EERNN, we simply summarize each student's state into an integrated vector and trace it with a recurrent neural network, where we design a bidirectional LSTM to learn the encoding of each exercise from its content. For making final predictions, we design two implementations on the basis of EERNN with different prediction strategies, i.e., EERNNM with Markov property and EERNNA with Attention mechanism. Then, to explicitly track student's knowledge acquisition on multiple knowledge concepts, we extend EERNN to an explainable Exercise-aware Knowledge Tracing (EKT) framework by incorporating the knowledge concept information, where the student's integrated state vector is now extended to a knowledge state matrix. In EKT, we further develop a memory network for quantifying how much each exercise can affect the mastery of students on multiple knowledge concepts during the exercising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate both EERNN and EKT frameworks on a largescale real-world data. The results in both general and cold-start scenarios clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of two frameworks in student performance prediction as well as the superior interpretability of EKT.",,,,,,,,,133,20,0,0,3,0,150,,,1041-4347,1558-2191,,,,,,,"Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Techonol, Anhui Prov Key Lab Big Data Anal & Applicat, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R ChinaRutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch, Management Sci & Informat Syst Dept, Newark, NJ 07102 USAIFLYTEK Co Ltd, iFLYTEK Res, Hefei 230088, Anhui, Peoples R China",IFLYTEK Co Ltd,,,2021-01-01,WOS:000597150000008,

As a major task of ITS, Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to capture a student's dynamic knowledge state based on his historical response sequences and provide personalized learning assistance to him. However, most existing KT methods have encountered the data sparsity problem. In real scenarios, an online tutoring system usually has an extensive collection of questions while each student can only interact with a limited number of questions. As a result, the records of some questions could be extremely sparse, which degrades the performance of traditional KT models. To resolve this issue, we propose a Dual-channel Heterogeneous Graph Network (DHGN) to learn informative representations of questions from students' records by capturing both the high-order heterogeneous and local relations. As the supervised learning manner applied in previous methods is incapable of exploiting unobserved relations between questions, we innovatively integrate a self-supervised framework into the KT task and employ contrastive learning via the two channels of DHGN, supplementing as an auxiliary task to improve the KT performance. Moreover, we adopt the attention mechanism, which has achieved impressive performance in natural language processing tasks, to effectively capture students' knowledge state. But the standard attention network is inapplicable to the KT task because the current knowledge state of a student usually shows strong dependency on his recently interactive questions, unlike the situation of language processing tasks, which focus more on the long-term dependency. To avoid the inefficiency of standard attention networks in the KT task, we further devise a novel Hybrid Attentive Network (HAN), which produces both the global attention and the hierarchical local attention to model the long-term and short-term intents, respectively. Then, by the gating network, a student's long-term and short-term intents are combined for efficient prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant performance improvement compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed dual-channel framework and attentive network.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0957-4174,1873-6793,,,,,,,"Univ Sci & Technol China, 440 Huangshan Rd, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China",,,,2023-06-05,WOS:000988069400001,

Particularly, this forget gating mechanism is built upon attention forgetting features over latent concepts considering their mutual dependencies. Further, this model has the capability of learning relationships between latent concepts from a dynamic latent concept graph in light of a student's evolving knowledge states.

Knowledge tracing is an application of time series machine learning. It consists of inferring the mastery level of a skill for a student as they navigate a question bank, thus adjusting curriculum for efficient learning. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) takes the deep learning approach for knowledge tracing and has achieved better results than models like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Performance Factor Analysis (PFA). However, the opaqueness of these deep knowledge tracing models also brings some criticisms. Providing an uncertainty score for each prediction helps mitigate this opaqueness. To investigate uncertainty modeling in DKT, we first examine a popular way of modeling data dependent uncertainties using Monte Carlo and show how it is insufficient to model variance in data. Second, we show how to incorporate sensible uncertainties by explicitly regularizing the cross entropy loss function. Third, we evaluate our method both in three different real datasets and in a more controlled way using synthetic data. Using synthetic data allows us to quantitatively understand the generated uncertainties. The results show that our method provides comparable results with standard deep knowledge tracing models as well as meaningful prediction uncertainties. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study used CiteSpace and VOSviewer to conduct a bibliometric analysis of 644 adaptive learning journal papers indexed in the WoS database from 2000 to 2022. This study presented a general view of the field of adaptive learning research over the last two decades using quantitative analysis. Currently, adaptive learning research is rapidly developing. In terms of the major research forces, a core group of authors including Qiao J. F., Han H. G. and Song Q has been formed; the major publishing country in this field is China; the core publishing journals include IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems. Four major research topics in this field were identified using cluster analysis, namely the application of deep learning in educational data analysis, the development and application of adaptive learning model in AI education, the development and application of intelligent tutoring system in tutoring and teaching, cutting-edge modeling technology for feature modeling and knowledge tracing. Through evolution analyses, the logic of adaptive learning research's development was determined; that is, technological changes have played a key role in the development of this field. Following the logic, we presented three frontiers of adaptive learning with burst terms: feature extraction, adaptation model and computational modeling. Adaptive learning is a core research topic for both computer science and educational technology disciplines, and it is also an important field where emerging technologies empowering education and teaching can play a part. The findings of the study clearly presented the current research status, evolutionary logic and research frontiers of this topic, which can provide references for the further development of this research field.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,"Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Educ Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Foreign Languages, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R ChinaChinese Univ Hong Kong, Instruction Fac Educ, Dept Curriculum, Hongkong 999077, Peoples R China",,,,2023-03-18,WOS:000940578200001,

The learning behaviours data describes three main types of learning behaviours: learning process, learning end, and learning interval. The classical knowledge tracing models only use the data of the learning end, which contains limited information and the models cannot accurately describe constraint in the same learning behaviour in the time series. Subsequent models add other types of learning behaviours data but do not integrate different types of learning behaviours, and the models cannot accurately describe collaboration in different learning behaviours. To address these issues, knowledge tracing via attention-enhanced encoder-decoder is proposed to synthesize and analyse the three types of learning behaviours mentioned above and firstly adopts the multiheaded attention mechanism to describe constraint in the same learning behaviours; secondly adopts the channel attention mechanism modelling collaboration in the three types of learning behaviours. In the experiments, various comparisons are made with related models on several real data sets, and the results show that our model achieves certain advantages in terms of performance and knowledge state representation.

Moreover, existing graph-based knowledge tracing models focus on the static relationship between exercises and skills, ignoring the dynamic graphs formed by students exercises in a session. In this work, we propose a novel knowledge tracing model which is based on an exercise session graph, named session graph based knowledge tracing (SGKT). The session graph is used to model the students' answering process. In addition, a relationship graph is used to model the relationship between exercises and skills. Then we use gated graph neural networks to obtain the students' knowledge state from the session graph and use graph convolutional networks to obtain the embedding representations of exercises and skills in the relationship graph. Next, through the interaction mechanism, multiple interaction states composed of knowledge states and embedding representations are obtained. The attention mechanism is used to find the focus from these states and make predictions.

However, most existing deep learning based knowledge tracing models have the following limitations: (1) Only use the correct/incorrect response, ignoring useful information from other modalities. (2) For works do consider multimodality use simple concatenation, which might not be the best way for modality fusion. (3) Design their network architectures manually via trial and error. To solve these problems, we propose Multimodal Fusion and Neural Architecture Search (MFNAS) in this paper. The commonly used neural architecture search technique could be considered as a special case of our proposed approach when there is only one modality involved. We further propose to use a new metric called time-weighted Area Under the Curve (weighted AUC) to measure how a sequence model performs with time. Our proposed approach MFNAS allows more efficient design of Knowledge Tracing models. Besides, evaluated on two public real datasets, the discovered model is able to achieve around 12% improvement in coefficient of determination, 2% improvement in AUC and weighted AUC compared with state of the art models.

The benefit of knowledge tracing is that students' learning plans can be better organised and adjusted, and interventions can be made when necessary. With the recent rise of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) has utilised Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to accomplish this task with some success. Other works have attempted to introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and redefine the task accordingly to achieve significant improvements. However, these efforts suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (1) they pay too much attention to details of the nodes rather than to high-level semantic information; (2) they struggle to effectively establish spatial associations and complex structures of the nodes; and (3) they represent either concepts or exercises only, without integrating them. Inspired by recent advances in self-supervised learning, we propose a Bi-Graph Contrastive Learning based Knowledge Tracing (Bi-CLKT) to address these limitations. Specifically, we design a two-layer comparative learning scheme based on an exercise-to-exercise (E2E) relational subgraph. It involves node-level contrastive learning of subgraphs to obtain discriminative representations of exercises, and graph-level contrastive learning to obtain discriminative representations of concepts. Moreover, we designed a joint contrastive loss to obtain better representations and hence better prediction performance. Also, we explored two different variants, using RNN and memory-augmented neural networks as the prediction layer for comparison to obtain better representations of exercises and concepts respectively. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed Bi-CLKT and its variants outperform other baseline models. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In JKT, it is not only possible to establish connections between exercises under cross-concepts, but also to help capture high-level semantic information and increase the model's interpretability.

Generally, student performance prediction is achieved by tracing the evolution of each students knowledge states via a series of learning activities. Every learning activity record has two types of feature data: student behavior and exercise features. However, most methods use features that are related to exercises, such as correctness and concepts, while other student behavior features are usually ignored. The few studies that have focused on student behavior features through subjective manual selection argue that different student behavior features can be used in an equivalent manner to predict student performance. In this paper, we assume that the integration of student behavior features and exercise features is crucial to improve the precision of prediction, and each feature has a different impact on student performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework for student performance prediction by making full use of both student behavior features and exercise features and combining the attention mechanism with the knowledge tracing model. Specifically, we first exploit machine learning to capture feature representation automatically. Then, a fusion attention mechanism based on recurrent neural network architecture is used for student performance prediction.

How to mine and analyze education big data has become an urgent problem in the field of education and big data knowledge engineering. As for the dynamic learning data, knowledge tracing aims to track learners' knowledge status over time by analyzing the learners' exercise data, so as to predict their performance in the next time step. Deep learning knowledge tracking performs well, but they mainly model the knowledge components while ignoring the personalized information of questions and learners, and provide limited interpretability in the interaction between learners' knowledge status and questions. A context-aware attentive knowledge query network (CAKQN) model is proposed in this paper, which combines flexible neural network models with interpretable model components inspired by psychometric theory. We use the Rasch model to regularize the embedding of questions and learners' interaction tuples, and obtain personalized representations from them. In addition, the long-term short-term memory network and monotonic attention mechanism are used to mine the contextual information of learner interaction sequences and question sequences. It can not only retain the ability to model sequences, but also use the monotonic attention mechanism with exponential decay term to extract the hidden forgetting behavior and other characteristics of learners in the learning process. Finally, the vector dot product is used to simulate the interaction between the learners' knowledge state and questions to improve the interpretability. A series of experimental results on 4 real-world online learning datasets show that CAKQN has the best performance, and its AUC value is improved by an average of 2.945% compared with the existing optimal model.

A novel metric, the approaching index, was developed using the tree edit distance in abstract syntax trees to measure the similarities between the learners' intermediate solutions and the optimal solution. The proposed method allows for each learner's programming path to be represented as a raw approaching index sequence (AISeq) or as a single variable (AIScore) by averaging the AISeq. A logistic regression model was first designed to predict the learners' performances using their AIScore, the number of attempts, and their current performance. A second model, a recurrent neural network model, was also developed to directly use the AISeq and to make predictions. To verify the effectiveness of these models, a series of statistical analyses and experiments were conducted on two existing large-scale block-based programming datasets, the results from which revealed that the proposed models were competitive with four state-of-the-art models on multiple metrics, such as the precision-recall curve, accuracy, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa.

Five learning behavior features were selected based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with students' final grades. Through testing with data from the fall semester of 2020, the model attained the highest ROC-AUC value of 0.9390. Based on these models, the researchers conducted an engagement intervention that displayed learning behavior dashboards to students in the fall of 2021. During the intervention, the course platform updated the dashboards and notified students weekly. This intervention was further investigated through a randomized controlled trial. The experimental results suggested that the intervention could improve students' learning behavior in terms of total study time, tutorial reading, and video viewing. In addition, this study used a modified dynamic key-value memory network model to depict a student's knowledge state and to calculate the probability of solving an exercise by mining numerous exercise records. Based on the predicted probability, instructors could recommend personalized exercises for each student. In the fall of 2021, the researchers also conducted a randomized controlled trial on this intervention, demonstrating that this personalized exercise recommendation could increase students' concept mastery. Experiments revealed that the proposed models and interventions had a positive effect on students' learning of course content.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1939-1382,,,,,,,,"Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Virtual Real Technol & Syst, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",,,,2023-07-27,WOS:001012684000011,

Aiming at this, a personalized exercise recommendation framework is proposed in this paper. First, it automatically constructs the relationship matrix between questions and concepts based on students' answering records (abbreviated as Q-matrix). Then based on the Q-matrix and answer records, deep knowledge tracing is used to automatically build the course knowledge graph. Then, based on each student's answer records, Q-matrix and the course knowledge graph, a recommendation algorithm is designed to obtain the knowledge structure diagram of every student. Combined the knowledge structure diagram and constructivist learning theory, get candidate recommended exercises from the exercise bank. Finally, based on their diversity, difficulty, novelty and other characteristics, exercises are filtered and obtain the exercises recommended to students. In the experimental part, the proposed framework is compared with other algorithms on the real data set.

First, the generalizability of findings in past research has been limited due to the relatively small numbers of participants in available studies. Second, it is not clear which specific skills are contingent upon mastery of identified threshold concepts, making it difficult to identify appropriate times for possible intervention.

Models were trained using labels generated through a new method of manually hand-coding log files, text replay tagging. This approach led to detectors that can automatically and accurately identify these inquiry skills under student-level cross-validation. The resulting detectors can be applied at run-time to drive scaffolding intervention. They can also be leveraged to automatically score all practice attempts, rather than hand-classifying them, and build models of latent skill proficiency.

Due to the different knowledge level of students and the large scale of exercise banks, it is difficult for general recommenders to recommend suitable exercises for each student, which decreases their learning efficiency. In this paper, we develop a 2-layer multi-objective framework for exercise recommendation with self-attention networks, abbreviated as MulOER-SAN, to capture the change in students' knowledge acquisition and thus provide customized exercise recommendations. Note that MulOER-SAN is a 2-layer framework. Via the bottom layer, a self-attention mechanism is adopted to predict the coverage in the next exercise, which can lead the learning process in the right direction. Moreover, we implement a novel knowledge tracing model with an enhanced self-attention sub-layer, thus tracing students' dynamic knowledge state evolution. As the top layer of the 2-layer model, exercises are filtered according to the bottom layer's predicted results, and the candidate subsets with appropriate difficulty and novelty are generated. From the perspective of diversity, we also carefully develop a chaotic sparrow search algorithm to further filter the candidate subset to avoid redundancy of recommended results. On the above basis, a simple yet effective difficulty smoothness factor is implemented to generate a high -quality ranking list in a real teaching application scenario.

This paper proposes a graph-based method with multi-hierarchical network (Caps-HAGKT) for tracking capsule knowledge, which integrates rich structural information of the knowledge space, including multiple skills, prerequisites, attribution, and conceptual meta-paths. Firstly, we use the multi-hierarchical knowledge capsule network to track a variety of high-level knowledge concepts, and then extract the latent knowledge structure between levels. In addition, we adopt a new graph network with an external memory matrix to model the relationship between concept capsules at the same level and update concept states. In previous works, it was difficult to use complex graph information without any expert pre-definition. In Caps-HAGKT, the semantic attention of knowledge capsules is used to merge different semantics in knowledge according to their importance.

LKD obtains the learner knowledge proficiency on skills by modeling their learning performance. Learners' knowledge construction process is not static, but evolves overtime; hence, the evolution of learners' knowledge proficiency must be dynamically traced. Moreover, considering the wide usage of online learning systems by large numbers of learners, the LKD task also needs to meet the requirements of large-scale assessment and interpretability to explain the diagnosed results. The existing models are either designed for static scenarios or find it difficult to explain the causality between learner performance and knowledge proficiency, as well as the item characteristics. To solve these issues, we propose herein a novel model, called the knowledge interaction-enhanced dynamic LKD (KIEDLKD), to develop learner performance, and hence, dynamically diagnose and trace the evolution of each learner's knowledge proficiency during the exercising activities. We first propose a dynamic LKD framework by unifying the strength of the memory capacity of the key-value memory network to enhance the representation of the knowledge state during learner performance modeling and the interpretability of the Item Response Theory (IRT) to explain the learner performance in terms of knowledge proficiency and item characteristics (i.e., item difficulty and discrimination). In this framework, we diagnose and trace each learner's knowledge proficiency on each knowledge concept (KC) over time and store them into an auxiliary memory using the key-value memory network. We further infer their general proficiencies and the IRT-based item characteristics using another neural network. Moreover, we propose the knowledge interaction concept among KCs and incorporate it into the LKD procedure to further exploit the long-term dependencies in the exercising sequences, thereby devising the KIEDLKD model. We also incorporate the learner oriented cognitive item difficulty into our model, based on each learner's exercising history, to adaptively model the item difficulty. Based on these factors, our KIEDLKD model can not only output the learners' knowledge proficiency in a multi-granularity manner but also output the item characteristics, making it possible to interpret the learner performances in terms of their current knowledge states and item characteristics. Extensive experiments are conducted from six perspectives on five real-world datasets to test our model.The results of learner performance prediction demonstrate the superiority of our model on the LKD task. It can also automatically discover the underlying interaction between each pair of latent KCs, and the underlying concepts for each exercise. The ablation study verifies the contributions of each component in our model. Moreover, it can depict the evolution of learner knowledge proficiency in a multi-granularity manner and provide additional information for skill domain analysis, which enables the interpretability of our model.
